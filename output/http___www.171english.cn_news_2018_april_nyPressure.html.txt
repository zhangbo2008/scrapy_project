This effect occurs during and immediately after a workout, so the blood-pressure benefits from exercise are most pronounced right after you work out.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, the best way to fight hypertension may be to divvy up your workout into bite-size pieces. In a 2012 study by Dr. Gaesser, three 10-minute walks spread throughout the day were better at preventing subsequent spikes in blood pressure 鈥� which can indicate worsening blood pressure control 鈥� than one 30-minute walk. And if even a 10-minute walk sounds daunting, try standing more often. In another study led by Dr. Gaesser and published in August, overweight volunteers with blood pressure problems were asked to sit continuously during an eight-hour workday while their blood pressure was monitored. The readings were, as expected, unhealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when, during another workday, those volunteers stood up every hour for at least 10 minutes, their blood pressure readings improved substantially.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe readings were even better when, on additional workdays, the volunteers strolled at a pokey 1-mile-per-hour pace at treadmill desks for at least 10 minutes every hour or pedaled under-desk exercise bikes for the same number of minutes every hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淓xercise intensity does not appear to play any significant role鈥� in helping people control blood pressure, Dr. Gaesser says. Movement is what matters. So go for a stroll a few times during the day or simply stand up more often to develop healthier blood pressure.\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圙RETCHEN REYNOLDS锛�\r\nQuestion: What is the best exercise to control high blood pressure?\r\n\r\n\r\n鎻愰棶锛氭帶鍒惰鍘嬬殑鏈�浣抽敾鐐兼柟寮忔槸浠�涔堬紵\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer: Take your pick, as the best exercise to control high blood pressure seems to be virtually any exercise, like walking or cycling or light weight training, especially if your workouts are spread throughout the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n鍥炵瓟锛氫换浣曢敾鐐奸兘濂斤紝鍑犱箮鎵�鏈夎繍鍔ㄥ鎺у埗琛�鍘嬮兘闈炲父鏈夋晥锛屾瘮濡傛琛屻�侀獞杞︽垨鏄交鐨勮礋閲嶇粌涔狅紝鍏ㄥぉ寮忕殑閿荤偧浼氳鍑忓帇鏁堟灉鏇村ソ銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淓ven standing might work,鈥� says Glenn Gaesser, the director of the Healthy Lifestyles Research Center at Arizona State University and an expert on exercise and hypertension.\r\n\r\n\r\n浜氬埄妗戦偅宸炵珛澶у鍋ュ悍鐢熸椿鏂瑰紡鐮旂┒涓績鐨勪富浠绘牸鏋椔风洊鐟熷皵鏄綅閿荤偧涓庨珮琛�鍘嬫柟闈㈢殑涓撳锛屼粬璁や负鈥滃摢鎬曠珯鐫�涔熶細鏈夊府鍔┿�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise lowers blood pressure in large part by altering blood vessel stiffness so blood flows more freely.
