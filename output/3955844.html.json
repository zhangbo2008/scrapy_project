If you are constantly rushing out the door but still can't seem to make a rendezvous on time, maybe it's time for a lifestyle change. Read on to find out the seven habits of extremely punctual people, but don't put them off until tomorrow!\n　　面试迟到，开会迟到，约会迟到――迟到不仅十分无礼，而且会对自己的事业和人际关系产生负面影响。如果你总是急急忙忙出门，但是还是无法准时赴约，也许，是时候改变一下自己的生活方式了。下面为大家解读准时达人的七个好习惯―不要等到明天再读啊!\n　　1. They're realistic.\n　　1. 做事切合实际。\n　　People who are chronically late underestimate how long it will take them to take a shower, get dressed, and reach a destination. Punctual people are realistic about their time and will often add a few extra minutes to give themselves some wiggle room. If you want to start planning realistically, write down how long you think it takes you to do your morning routine. Then for a week, track how long it actually takes you to get ready, and use that new estimate when planning out your mornings.\n　　一个人长期迟到是因为低估了做事需要花费的时间，例如，洗澡，穿衣，到达某个地方等。准时的人会对自己的时间作出合理的安排，他们经常会预留出几分钟的空余时间。如果你想对自己的计划进行合理的安排，记下自己预估的早上完成所有事情要花费的时间。在接下来的一个星期里，记下自己实际花费的时间。利用这些数据重新评估一下早上行程所花费时间。\n　　2. They prepare for unexpected delays.\n　　2. 为无法预计的延误做好准备。\n　　Punctual people prepare for any unforeseen delays due to traffic, getting lost, forgetting something at home, etc. If they're going somewhere that is 10 minutes away, they leave 20 to 25 minutes ahead to account for any unexpected scenarios. By giving themselves buffer time, they often arrive early ― but never late.\n　　准时的人会为未知的延误做好准备，例如，由于交通状况造成的延误，由于迷路造成的拖延，还有可能因为东西丢在了家里等等。如果到达某个地方需要10分钟，他们都会提前20-25分钟出门，为了防止出现未知的状况。通过预留时间，他们通常都会早到，但绝不会迟到。\n　　3. They're fine with downtime.\n　　3. 等待时间，同样自在。\n　　Because punctual people give themselves buffer time, they often arrive early ― and they are more than comfortable enjoying a few minutes waiting. Whether they are checking emails, reviewing notes, reading a book, or clearing their heads, punctual people not only enjoy their downtime, but also come prepared with something to do. People who are chronically late, however, do not enjoy their downtime and prefer the thrill of rushing to and from a place. If you want to be more comfortable waiting for someone, then bring a book or an iPad to help pass the time.\n　　因为准时的人总会预留出时间，所以他们通常都会提前到达，而且也很享受这几分钟等待的时间。不论是检查一下自己的邮件，回顾一下自己的笔记，读一本书还是理一理自己的思路，准时的人都会享受自己这段等待的时间，而且还会准备好做些其他的事情。总是迟到的人，正好相反，从来不会享受自己等待的时间。他们更喜欢忙忙碌碌从一个地方冲向另一个地方。如果你想享受等待某人的时光，带一本书，或带上自己的iPad来打发时间。\n　　4. They plan everything down to the T.\n　　4. 计划好每件事情。\n　　Extremely punctual people not only show up to places on time, but also lead highly structured and organized lifestyles. They plan out their mornings, days, and nights with a set of activities and routines and stick to them every day. They keepcalendars up to date with new meetings and appointments and try not to overschedule. Being organized with your belongings can also save you time ― keep your keys, wallet, and phone in a designated area so that you don't have to search for them in the mornings. To become more punctual, try adding more structure to your daily routine!\n　　准时达人不仅会准时出现在该去的地方，而且也会极好的安排自己的生活，使生活充满规律和条理。他们会为早上，白天和晚上安排一系列的活动，每天坚持。这些人会随时更新自己日程表上的会议和约会记录，而且避免出现超负荷安排。有条理的摆放自己的东西也可以节省很多时间，例如，钥匙、钱包和手机都放在指定的地方，这样的话就不需要大早上找这些东西。想要更加准时就要把自己的日常生活安排的更加有条理。\n　　5. They get things done ahead of time.\n　　5. 提前把事情完成。\n　　Punctual people get everything done ahead of time, because procrastinating means stressing out and scrambling at the last minute. They pick out what to wear and pack their bags the night before. If they're packing lunch for work, they do that the night before as well. By getting things done early, they have less to worry about in the morning and can focus on being punctual.\n　　准时的人都会提前把事情完成，因为拖延就意味着承受很大的压力，在最后一刻还慌张忙乱。准时的人会在前一天晚上把第二天要穿的衣服选好，并整理好自己的包。如果工作要带午餐，他们也会在头一天晚上做好。提前把事情做好，第二天早上担心的事情就会变少，就会准时上班。\n　　6. They go to bed early.\n　　6. 睡觉很早。\n　　Why do most people stay up late? Probably because they waited until the last minute to finish an assignment or project. Naturally, punctual people don't stay up as late, because they avoid procrastinating. By getting to bed early, they sleep better and wake up feeling rested.\n　　为什么大多数人都要熬夜呢?很可能是因为他们要在最后一刻才把工作或任务做好。自然而然，准时的人就不会熬夜，因为他们避免拖延。因为准时睡觉，他们的睡眠质量就会很好，醒来之后也会感觉精力充沛。\n　　7. They're morning people.\n　　7. 起床很早。\n　　On a similar note, punctual people don't press the snooze button ― they get up when they're supposed to. Because they sleep better after getting to bed earlier, they don't have trouble waking up. They go to bed and get up at reliable hours to start their days off right.\n　　同样的，准时的人不会按下闹钟的“贪睡”按钮――他们会准时起床。因为早睡，所以睡眠质量更好，也就没有不想起床的问题。他们睡觉和起床都很守时，也就开启了新的美好一天。"
