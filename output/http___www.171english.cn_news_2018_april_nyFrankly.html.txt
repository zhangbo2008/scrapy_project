"By BONNIE ROCHMAN; APRIL 4, 2018\r\nReasons Why I Shouldn鈥檛 Have to Go Tonight: If I wanted to talk about it, I would. / It鈥檚 my body. / It鈥檚 a waste of time. / It鈥檚 a waste of money. / I know what I need to know. / It sounds pretty stupid to me. / It鈥檚 so stereotypical because obviously I know this happens to everyone. / Considering I took the time out of my morning to write you these extremely reasonable and great reasons not to make me go (and it took forever because I can鈥檛 type very well), and the fact that I really, really, really, really . . . really, really, really strongly don鈥檛 want to go, please don鈥檛 send us to this horrible torture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE DON鈥橳 MAKE ME GO. I DON鈥橳 WANT TO GO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plea came from Leah Likin, a fifth grader. It was addressed to her mother, who had registered both of them for a two-part course on puberty called 鈥淔or Girls Only.鈥� The missive, which included additional objections, failed: Mother took daughter anyway. But Leah had plenty of company, peers who shared her resistance, their arms crossed, their eyes downcast. Last year, the course, which is split into sessions for preteen boys and girls and held mostly in and around Seattle, and also in the Bay Area, pulled in 14,000 attendees. They heard about it from their pediatricians, or through word of mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe creator of the course, Julie Metzger, has been trying for nearly three decades to turn what鈥檚 so often at best a blush-inducing experience 鈥� the 鈥渇acts of life鈥� talk 鈥� into a candid dialogue between parents and children. In the mid-1980s, she was a graduate student at the University of Washington School of Nursing when she reviewed survey data on how women had learned about menarche, or the onset of menstruation, for her master鈥檚 thesis. Most reported getting information from gym class or their mothers. 鈥淵ou can picture those conversations lasting from 10 seconds to 10 hours,鈥� Metzger says. 鈥淎nd I thought, Wouldn鈥檛 it be interesting if you actually had a class where you sit with your parents and hear these things from someone? What if that class were fun and funny and interactive?鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nMetzger, who is 56 and vigorous, with flushed cheeks and blue eyes, says she has always been comfortable talking about sexuality; her father was a urologist, her mother a nurse. 鈥淗and me a microphone,鈥� she says. 鈥淚 get so into this topic that I can make myself cry in front of the class, and it鈥檚 real.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nHer class on puberty debuted in 1988 at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, where she was the nurse manager of the pediatrics unit. The class was so crowded, she says, that 鈥渨e had to run it twice.鈥� That reception convinced her that there was an appetite for a forthright talk about growing up. Soon after she moved back West in 1990 鈥� she was raised in Portland, Ore. 鈥� Metzger began offering the course at Seattle Children鈥檚 Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淧arents walk in feeling almost victimized by preteens and puberty, and my job is to utterly transform their ability to connect,鈥� she says. 鈥淭hat sounds so arrogant, but I know when I walk in that room, that is my work.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a recent winter evening, Metzger stood at the door to the hospital auditorium and greeted every mother-daughter pair with animation, as if she鈥檇 known them for years, and told each girl to take an index card and a ballpoint pen with the name of her company, Great Conversations, on it. The first hour of each class amounts to an informative stand-up routine 鈥� Metzger sticks a sanitary pad on her shoulder to show that it won鈥檛 slip around 鈥� but the second hour is devoted to answering the girls鈥� questions. Metzger believes that having kids pose questions fosters intimacy and allows parents to hear for themselves what their children鈥檚 concerns are. In the first class, when the focus is on the physical changes caused by puberty, Metzger tends to be asked: Why do we have pubic hair? What does it feel like to have a growth spurt? How do I know when I鈥檓 getting my period?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the girls scribbled on their index cards, some used their elbows to block an inquisitive mother鈥檚 gaze. (Bolder girls will sometimes go so far as to write things like 鈥淭his is from Susan in the third row, in the red shirt.鈥�) After intermission, during which Metzger collected the cards into a disorderly pile, she put on a pair of thick red reading glasses and began.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淐an boys stick a tampon in their penis?鈥� she read. 鈥淎bsolutely not. They can try, but I wouldn鈥檛 recommend it.鈥� She flung the card to the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淒o you always get a baby from having sex?鈥� she read. 鈥淢y husband and I have been married 28 years. We may have had sex over 1,000 times. I am happy to report we do not have 1,000 children. There are ways to show and share your love without having a baby.鈥� Another card flew out of her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淒oes having sex hurt?鈥� she read. 鈥淲hen people bring their bodies together, their ear might go into your elbow, but because you have chosen someone you love and trust, you say, 鈥楶lease get your elbow out of my ear.鈥� And they would say, 鈥極f course.鈥� Do I look like someone who would choose something 1,000 times if it was painful? No, I do not.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second class of every course delves into the opposite sex鈥檚 puberty, along with reproduction and decision making. Metzger can count on at least one girl asking how you know if you want to have sex with someone. At the class I attended, she got the expected question, then walked briskly to one side of the auditorium and said: 鈥淟et鈥檚 say it鈥檚 8:12 on a Tuesday night, and you walk by a complete stranger. What would you do?鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淣othing,鈥� the girls chirped.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淲hat if it鈥檚 8:12, and you run into Ralph from Jamba Juice, and your family gets a Jamba Juice every Saturday. What would you do?鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淪ay hi,鈥� someone yelled. With each question, Metzger moved a few steps toward the other side of the room. 鈥淲hat if it鈥檚 your friend whom you haven鈥檛 seen since 2:30? What鈥檚 your feeling?鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淗appy!鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淲hat are the consequences? Sleepover! Now what if you spot your grandmother? You give her a big hug, and what鈥檚 the consequence? She takes you shopping. But what if I go over to a stranger and shake her hand? What if I give Ralph a huge hug like you did your grandmother?鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girls snickered. By now, Metzger had reached the other side of the room, her movement reinforcing the notion that different relationships call for different behaviors. 鈥淥hh,鈥� Metzger said with exaggeration. 鈥淵ou鈥檙e saying my actions don鈥檛 reflect my feelings for these people? If you鈥檙e telling me that, then if two people brought their bodies so close that a penis actually went inside a vagina, that鈥檚 enormous. If it鈥檚 true what you鈥檙e telling me, that this seems to be one of the biggest human-being actions, I have to put it together with some of the biggest human-being qualities 鈥� trust, respect, love, commitment. That鈥檚 why some people say this action belongs only to grown-ups, and that鈥檚 why some people say this action belongs only in marriage.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nBoys and girls experience puberty differently. For girls, puberty typically begins at 10 or 11 and lasts five to six years, punctuated by distinct events 鈥� breast development and the onset of menstruation. Puberty for boys starts later, around 11 or 12, and lasts longer. Many girls are done with puberty 鈥� over, by definition, when growth stops 鈥� in their sophomore year of high school. Boys, on the other hand, may still be growing in college, and some secondary sex characteristics, like beard growth, may not show up until they are in their 20s.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first night of the boys鈥� course includes a musical interlude, 鈥淭he Penis Opera,鈥� in which the falsetto of the boys is set off by the bass of their fathers. Preteen boys think saying 鈥減enis鈥� is funny, and my son, then 11, guffawed even as he looked around to gauge others鈥� reactions 鈥� perhaps because no one anywhere else ever shouts 鈥減enis鈥� at the top of his lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淢aybe you鈥檝e been using the word 鈥榳illy鈥� or 鈥榮tick鈥� or 鈥榯wig,鈥� 鈥� the instructor, Greg Smallidge, a sexuality educator who teaches many of the boys鈥� classes, told the audience. 鈥淲e were brought up for generations with people thinking it wasn鈥檛 O.K. to name these body parts. That鈥檚 why we need 鈥楾he Penis Opera.鈥� We need to talk about sexuality.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nYet what that conversation should include is far from settled. In 1913, Chicago鈥檚 became the first major school system in the United States to include sexuality as a subject. More than 100 years later, there is still no standardized curriculum. Detailed guidelines, released in 2012 as a resource for school districts, recommend minimum standards for comprehensive K-12 sex ed, but compliance is voluntary. 鈥淣o state or school district I鈥檓 aware of has adopted them in full,鈥� says Danene Sorace, who coordinated the development of the guidelines for Future of Sex Education, a partnership of three nonprofits. As a result, sex ed varies widely in schools. Some places, like New Jersey and Chicago, deliver age-specific lessons starting in kindergarten and continuing all the way through Grade 12. Other places, like Clark County, Nev., home to Las Vegas and the nation鈥檚 fifth-largest school district, teach abstinence-based curriculums. Many states have no policies; more than half receive a share of the $50 million that the federal government hands out each year to promote abstinence through community programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Conversations represents a distinct shift from the usual approach to sex education. Metzger believes that adolescence and puberty should be the purview of children and their parents, not solely that of children and their teachers. 鈥淭he idea that we are talking to two generations at the same time is at the core of this,鈥� she says.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a 2012 survey by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 87 percent of teenagers said 鈥渙pen, honest鈥� conversations with their parents could help them put off sex and avoid pregnancy. Students who take part in comprehensive sex-ed programs delay having sex for the first time, have less sex and fewer partners and rely more on contraception than their peers. (Conversely, abstinence-only instruction has not succeeded in extending virginity.) 鈥淎s parents of young children, we are really engaged,鈥� Sorace says. 鈥淏ut sexuality is such a taboo topic in our culture that when it comes to adolescence, we freeze.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThat鈥檚 probably why information about sex, whether from parents or schools, is so often delivered in serious, white-coat fashion, its clinical messages heavy with the fear of consequences. To those who advocate abstinence until marriage, attitudes like Metzger鈥檚 foster permissiveness. But limiting the conversation to abstinence, Metzger says, 鈥渋sn鈥檛 a full-enough understanding of sexuality.鈥� Because they are voluntary, Great Conversations courses are free to be more frank than school-based sex ed; they can sidestep detractors who think kids shouldn鈥檛 be taught about masturbation, for example. 鈥淲e are not saying you have to learn this,鈥� Metzger says. 鈥淧eople get to choose to come to us.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nMetzger鈥檚 greatest challenge might be figuring out how to speak in one voice to families from radically different backgrounds and viewpoints. For the most part, the course, which costs $70, attracts a well-educated, mostly homogeneous demographic. But over the years, Metzger and her business partner, Robert Lehman, who also runs the boys鈥� curriculum, have tried to appeal to lower-income parents. They found success in Palo Alto, where the class is regularly taught in Spanish. But in Seattle, Metzger says, she has struggled to find a community partner. A deal with the Y.M.C.A. fell through because of the need to simultaneously translate instructors鈥� rapid-fire delivery into several languages.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, Metzger got an email from a middle-school teacher she knows: Would Great Conversations want to teach a group of disadvantaged students 鈥� some homeless, others victims of abuse? Two of her instructors are interested, and Metzger is imagining what shape such a class would take. 鈥淚t wouldn鈥檛 be the same song and dance,鈥� she says.\r\n\r\n\r\nMetzger鈥檚 course might need to evolve in other ways. Lindsey Doe, a clinical sexologist whose YouTube channel, Sexplanations, tackles subjects ranging from kissing to anal sex, attended Great Conversations with her daughter. She was disappointed that the focus was limited to either boys or girls. Where would a transgender or an intersex child fit in? 鈥淚 loved the curriculum so much that I wanted it to be perfect, and that was the piece that would have completed my experience,鈥� Doe says.\r\n\r\n\r\nMetzger is open to the idea. Finding the right words to include adoptive families was tricky when she started teaching the course; now, it鈥檚 how to deal with sexual identity. 鈥淭here was a titanic shift five years ago when the audience began demanding a more open conversation around homosexuality and transgender experiences,鈥� she says. 鈥淲e鈥檙e always trying to balance the readiness of the room, and we may be running a bit behind.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November, my 10-year-old, Shira, and I attended For Girls Only. There was an undercurrent of nervous tension as we waited for the class to start. Mothers looked stressed, daughters embarrassed. Shira hadn鈥檛 wanted to come. 鈥淚 don鈥檛 want to learn about puberty,鈥� she pouted. 鈥淚 don鈥檛 even like the word.鈥� But as the girls looked around, some of them spying friends, they seemed emboldened: Maybe theirs weren鈥檛 the only parents to drag them to a talk about penises and vaginas.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then Metzger won them over. At one point, she handed out a diagram of a woman鈥檚 reproductive organs and challenged the girls to go home, stand naked in front of a mirror and superimpose the image over their abdomens to get a sense of where things were in their bodies. When Shira鈥檚 drawing fell to the floor, she gave me an impish grin and asked, 鈥淢om, could you pick up my uterus?鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nLater still, she leaned forward, intrigued, when the talk turned to how to insert a tampon; I鈥檇 never explained that to her. 鈥淪ome people worry they鈥檒l put it in too far,鈥� Metzger was saying. 鈥淲hat if you鈥檙e in social studies and it comes out your ear?鈥� She pantomimed stumbling across the room and pulling a tampon out of her ear; lots of laughter followed her. 鈥淭hat 鈥� 鈥� Metzger paused dramatically 鈥� 鈥渃annot happen.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nA month later, on a drizzly December Monday, I met with Leah Likin, now 14. She has long, curly hair that fades from brown to blond, and she twirled one lock around and around as she talked. I asked her why she was dead-set against going to Metzger鈥檚 class three years earlier. She struggled to explain herself. At last she said, with a blush that highlighted her freckles: 鈥淚 guess I didn鈥檛 want to grow up. I was happy with the way things were. I am realizing now that the class was superhelpful. Julie sends you away with this greater message that we are all in this together, that you鈥檙e fine,鈥� she said, referring to Metzger. 鈥淭hat鈥檚 what my mom always says: You are just right the way you are.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nBonnie Rochman is a health writer and is working on a book about how genetics is reshaping childhood.\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�4鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圔ONNIE
