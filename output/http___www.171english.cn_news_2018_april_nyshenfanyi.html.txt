It has a large sign outside showing some of its tastiest dishes, with English translations: 鈥淚n Bowl,鈥� 鈥淵ou Flour Silk,鈥� 鈥淏eef Cat鈥檚 Ear鈥� and a noodle dish in broth known as 鈥淪auce on My Grandma.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese and English languages are so completely different that you often see awkward translations like these. They may make English speakers chuckle, but Chinese officialdom is not amused: When major international events come to China, the state tries to clean up the most egregious ones. Before the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, for example, 400,000 signs and 1,300 menus were revised, including 鈥淩acist Park,鈥� a permanent cultural exhibition that was rebranded as 鈥淢inorities Park.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, a stroll through just about any Chinese city will reveal the joys of eating in China: A restaurant menu in Xian offers 鈥淭he Smell of Urine Dry Noodles.鈥� Shenzhen is proud of its famous 鈥淕ollum Shrimp.鈥� A Beijing restaurant serves 鈥淭he Hand That Grasps the Cowboy Bone鈥� and 鈥淔ried Swarm.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic institutions don鈥檛 do much better with their signs: One warns travelers in Shanghai to 鈥淏eware Wallet/Carefully Slide鈥� (it means to suggest that you should watch your wallet and your step on the slippery floor). In Beijing, some wheelchair-accessible bathrooms are marked 鈥淒eformed Person.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it is worth a visit to the Ecstasy retail clothing chain on the island of Taiwan just to see what is posted out front. Apparently unaware that its trademark is also a street name for the illegal drug MDMA, the store has signs saying, 鈥淲elcome to the Ecstasy World鈥� and 鈥淭he Ecstasy Family Make You Crazy.鈥�"
