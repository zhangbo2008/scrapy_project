" The change, announced on a blustery Tuesday morning in mid-February, was small but significant – and it elicited a big response.\r\n“This one is more beautiful!” Asset Kaipiyev exclaims in surprise. The co-founder of a small restaurant in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana, Kaipiyev had just been shown the latest version of the new alphabet, approved by President Nursultan Nazarbayev earlier in the day.\r\nThe government signed off on a new alphabet, based on a Latin script instead of Kazakhstan’s current use of Cyrillic, in October. But it has faced vocal criticism from the population – a rare occurrence in this nominally democratic country ruled by Nazarbayev’s iron fist for almost three decades.\r\nPinch and zoom on mobile to expand.\r\nIn this first version of the new alphabet,apostrophes were used to depict sounds specific to the Kazakh tongue, prompting critics to call it “ugly”.\r\nThe second variation, which Kaipiyev liked better, makes use of acute accents above the extra letters. So, for example, the Republic of Kazakhstan, which would in the first version have been Qazaqstan Respy’bli’kasy, is now Qazaqstan Respýblikasy, removing the apostrophes.\r\nYou might also like:- A 'thrilling' mission to get the Swedish to change overnight\r\n “It is more beautiful than the former variant,” says Kaipiyev. “I don’t like the old one because it looks like a tadpole.”\r\nThen it hit him. His restaurant, which opened in December, is called Sa’biz –spelt using the first version of the alphabet. All his marketing materials, the labelling on napkin holders and menus, and even the massive sign outside the building will have to be replaced.\r\nIn his attempt to get ahead by launching in the new alphabet, Kaipiyev had not predicted that the government would revise it. He thinks it will cost about $3,000 to change the spelling of the name on everything to the new version, Sábiz.\r\nWhat Kaipiyev and other small business owners are going through will be happening at a larger scale as the government aims to transition fully to the Latin-based script by 2025. It’s an ambitious goal in a nation where the majority of the population are more fluent in Russian than in Kazakh.\r\nMother tongue\r\n Years under Soviet rule mean Russian is spoken by nearly everyone in country – roughly 94% of the population is fluent in it \r\nFrequency of usage depends on the environment. In the Russian-influenced northern provinces and city centres, like Almaty and the capital Astana, Russian is used both on the street and in state offices. But in the south and west, Kazakh is more regularly used.\r\nThat the Kazakh language is currently written in Cyrillic – and the persistent use of Russian in elite circles – is a legacy of the Soviet Union’s rule, one that some of its neighbouring countries sought to shed right after the union’s collapse in 1991. Azerbaijan, for example, started introducing textbooks in Latin script the next year, while Turkmenistan followed suit in 1993. Kazakhstan is making the transition almost three decades on, in a different economic environment that makes the costs hard to predict.\r\nPinch and zoom on mobile to expand.\r\nThe cost of change\r\nSo far, state media has reported that the government’s total budget for the seven-year transition – which has been divided into three stages – will amount to roughly 218 billion tenge ($664m). About 90% of that amount is going to education programmes the publication of textbooks for education programmes in the new Latin script, including for literature classes.\r\nAccording to state news media, the government has allocated roughly 300 million tenge each ($922,000) for 2018 and 2019; this money will go towards education in primary and secondary schools, says Eldar Madumarov, an economist and professor at KIMEP University in Almaty.\r\n The government’s total budget for the seven-year transition will amount to roughly 218 billion tenge, or $664 million \r\nMeanwhile, the translation of teaching kits and textbooks will begin this year, according to state media, while teachers nationwide will start teaching pre-school and first grade students the new alphabet in 2020, adding a grade each year until 2025, when all levels from pre-school to the final grade will have fully transitioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also budget for developing a language converter IT program to recode Cyrillic script into Latin in the third quarter of 2018 (approximately $166,000), improving the qualifications of secondary school teachers ($33.2m), and hiring influential bloggers to push forward an awareness campaign for the final stage of the transition, beginning in 2024 ($1.4 million).\r\nBut without a clear breakdown provided by the government, some economists have found it difficult to properly assess the direct costs of this massive undertaking. (The ministries of foreign affairs, education, and culture did not respond to requests for comment and clarification.)\r\nHidden costs\r\nThe piecemeal reporting of how the transition will happen makes one economist worried about the unexpected costs.\r\n“If this reform is not properly implemented, the risks are high that highly qualified people from the Russian-speaking majority, which includes also ethnic Kazakhs, may want to consider emigration,” says Madumarov. “The risks may be that some of their opportunities would be cut.”\r\n If this reform is not properly implemented, highly qualified people from the Russian-speaking majority may want to consider emigration – Eldar Madumarov \r\nIn late February, the extent of the issue was on display when Nazarbayev – who is comfortably bilingual – ordered that all cabinet meetings be held in Kazakh. Since Russian has long been the lingua franca of state affairs, government officials’ command of Russian often surpasses their Kazakh. One meeting was broadcast over TV, and it showed officials struggling to express themselves. Some even opted to wear translation headsets.\r\nBureaucratic characters\r\nThere’s also the cost of changing the language of government affairs. IDs, passports, printed laws and regulations – all the paperwork that governments need in order to function will have to be translated. While this has been reportedly part of the second and final stage of the transition, there has been no listed amount for this expense, says Kassymkhan Kapparov, director of the Almaty-based Bureau for Economic Research of Kazakhstan. \r\nFor things like passports and IDs, there is already a fixed fee to renew, “so the only thing that would change is that the letters would just change in the software,” Kapparov says, adding that a new passport costs roughly $60 while an ID card is about $1.50. “The government left it blank. I think the logic is that it would not cost anything.”\r\nBut he remains most curious about the third stage, which reportedly begins in 2024 and includes the translation of internal business documents within the central and local state bodies, while state media would also need to implement the new alphabet.\r\n“For the state’s own media to use the new alphabet, you have to train people first of all, then you have to change all the IT infrastructure to embed this script. And then you have to change all the planks [signboards] and the letterheads and stamps and signs,” he says. “For that, they didn’t provide the estimate… based on my estimates, it would be somewhere between 15 to 30 million [dollars].”\r\nThat number is only for the public sector, though. “For the private sector, of course they would have to do it themselves. It could be double, it could be ten times,” Kapparov says. “It depends on how hard the government goes about it, like would they require it to change in a single year? It’s possible. With our government, you never know.”\r\nKapparov also worries that people, especially the older generation, would struggle to read and write in the new Latin script, so communications within the public sector may have to be in several languages at once.\r\n“You can call it the language burden, because when you write a letter inside the public sector, you would have to write it in Russian, in Kazakh, and in Kazakh in the new script… and for that you would need to employ translators,” he says. “This creates additional costs and additional inefficiencies and of course the government doesn’t show it in their budget. But it will create an additional burden on the government.”\r\nWhen it comes to direct costs, Kapparov is confident that his estimates – which he did in 2007 after the first feasibility study came out and again in January of this year when budgetary information started trickling out via state media – would not be more than $1bn for the entire transition.\r\nBut the director of Kazakhstan’s Centre for Macroeconomic Research, Olzhas Khudaibergenov, believes the whole transition will cost far less than Kapparov’s estimate. He thinks all paper documents costs will just be folded into the government’s usual budget. “Real expenses will be only for informational and explanatory programmes to support the transition.\r\n“I estimate that the annual budget will not exceed two to three billion tenge [$6.1m-$9.2m] within 2018 to 2025.”\r\nEconomic benefits?\r\nKapparov says this alphabet transition is “hard to sell” for the government, and there won’t be a direct return on investment.\r\n The alphabet change should be seen as more of a social and cultural development programme – Kassymkhan Kapparov \r\nRather, it “should be seen as more of a social and cultural development programme of the government,” he says.\r\nKhudaibergenov agrees. “It is more a question of national identity which we are trying to find, and are ready to pay for that.”\r\nKIMEP University professor Madumarov believes the economy could be slowed by political ramifications of the language change. While some have speculated that Nazarbayev’s decision to switch might signal cooling ties with Russia, the gradual shift to a Latin-script language could also weaken trade relations with post-Soviet countries.\r\nCurrently, up to 10% of the current trade flow between Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine can be explained by the convenience of a shared language, which in some ways translates to a shared culture and mentality, says Madumarov. This also means that Russian-speaking Kazakhs have more economic mobility between countries. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan and Georgia, nations that are not as fluent in Russian, have weaker trade links.\r\nInversely, he says that the benefits to having a Latin-script alphabet means being better integrated with most of the Western world. As an example, Turkey, which switched to a Latin-based alphabet from its former Arabic script in 1928, has managed to form alliances with the European Union and was in negotiations – up until recently, when the government moved towards a more autocratic direction – to be a member.\r\nTurkey has long been used as an example of how modernisation of the language and legal systems led to its position today as an economic power, says Barbara Kellner-Heinkele, a Berlin-based expert in Turkic languages and Turkic history. But she says this progress is due more to growing literacy and republic founder Ataturk’s firm grip over every aspect of society.\r\nTurkey’s 1928 switch to a Latin script “was done in no time”, but back then, few Turks could read and write: Ataturk needed educated people for his country to be on the same level as Europe and the US, “and part of the education drive was the new alphabet”, she says.\r\nAn independent nation\r\nKazakhstan’s transition is more about setting itself apart from its Soviet past than literacy or economics, Kellner-Heinkele says. “It is a political argument to show that they are an independent state and they are modern and they are a nation.”\r\nFazylzhanova Muratkyzy, a linguist who worked with the government to create the new alphabet, echoes this assessment, and says many Kazakhs associate the Cyrillic-based script to Soviet control.\r\nYoung people, especially, are welcoming the change.\r\nBased on surveys that her linguistic institute have conducted over the last decade, Muratkyzy says that 47% of the younger generation – aged 18 to 25 – supported a switch to a Latin-based script in 2007; that number jumped to 80% in 2016.\r\n 47% of the younger generation supported a switch to a Latin-based script in 2007; that number jumped to 80% in 2016 \r\n“It is the choice of the people, of the nation. And with this new alphabet, it is connected to our dreams and our future,” she says. “It shows that our independent history is finally beginning.”\r\nMunalbayeva Daurenbekovna, head of the National Academic Library, has been holding open classes for librarians and other interested parties to help them get used to the Latin script. She is optimistic the that young people especially will have no trouble learning the new script.\r\n“Teachers would have to learn every day for one month. For children, it would only take 10 lessons, because children learn faster than adults.”\r\nFor Kaipiyev, the owner of Sa’biz, moving away from the Cyrillic script – no matter how tedious it is for him as a small business owner – is something he fully supports. “We want to connect with Europe and America, and with other foreign countries. This will help us turn the page to the next chapter,” he says.\r\nAs for changing his restaurant material to reflect the latest version of the alphabet?\r\n“I think I will leave it the same for now,” Kaipiyev says, after a moment’s consideration. “We will change it when the people can actually read it.”\r\nAdditional reporting by Makhabbat Kozhabergenova. Additional research by Miriam Quick. \r\n这一改变在二月中旬一个狂风大作的周二早上公布，变化虽小却意义重大，而且反响剧烈。\r\n\r\n\r\n                    哈萨克斯坦政府十月通过了一套新字母，以拉丁字母为基础，以取代现行的西里尔字母。\r\n                \r\n \"这个好看多了！\"埃皮耶夫（Asset Kaipiyev）惊叹道。埃皮耶夫在哈萨克斯坦首都阿斯塔纳跟人合开了一家小餐馆，他刚刚看到当天早些时候获得总统努尔苏丹·纳扎尔巴耶夫（Nursultan Nazarbayev）批准颁布的最新版本字母。\r\n哈萨克斯坦政府十月通过了一套新字母，以拉丁字母为基础，以取代现行的西里尔字母。此举遭到了民众的公开批评，这在受到纳扎尔巴耶夫铁拳控制近30年，只名义上民主的国家，十分罕见。\r\n\r\n\r\n                    一套新字母——又一套。哈萨克斯坦第二套拉丁文字母更接近英语的拉丁字母而非西里尔字母，但也有自己的特点：英语拉丁字母（26个字母）；新版哈萨克语拉丁字母（32个字母）；旧版哈萨克语西里尔字母（42个字母）。只保留了4个西里尔字母，且英语中也有：A、E、I和O。\r\n                \r\n哈萨克斯坦第二套拉丁文字母更接近英语的拉丁字母而非西里尔字母，但也有自己的特点：英语拉丁字母（26个字母）；新版哈萨克语拉丁字母（32个字母）；旧版哈萨克语西里尔字母（42个字母）。\r\n新版的32个字母中只有23个在英语中也有。只保留了4个西里尔字母，且英语中也有：A、E、I和O。\r\n第一版新字母用撇号标记哈萨克语中的特殊发音，被批评\"难看\"。\r\n第二版，也就是埃皮耶夫比较喜欢的，改为在多出来的字母上使用尖音符。例如哈萨克斯坦共和国在第一版中拼为Qazaqstan Respy'bli'kasy，现在是Qazaqstan Resp'yblikasy，去掉了撇号。\r\n\"这个比上一版好看多了，我不喜欢之前那个，看着跟蝌蚪似的。\"埃皮耶夫说。\r\n然后他意识到，自己12月新开的餐馆Sa'biz用了第一版的拼法。所有宣传资料、餐巾托架上的标志、菜单，还有屋外的大灯箱牌，全都要换。\r\n埃皮耶夫想着早点使用新字母，但没想到政府会再改。他预计，把所有拼写都改成新版的Sábiz大概要花3千美元。\r\n政府计划2025年之前全面改用拉丁字母，埃皮耶夫和小商家们现在所经历的将大范围出现。在这个俄语比哈萨克语更普及的国家，推行拉丁字母可是个雄心壮志。\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Sa'biz的合伙人埃皮耶夫换了餐厅名的拼写，现在又得再换一次。\r\n                \r\n根据哈萨克斯坦2016年的人口普查，全国约三分之二的人口为哈萨克族，约20%是俄罗斯民族，但由于苏联多年的统治几乎人人都说俄语，1,800多万人口中差不多有94%的人流利掌握俄语，哈萨克语以74%排在第二。\r\n语言使用的频繁程度取决于环境。在受俄罗斯影响的北部省份和城市中心，譬如阿拉木图和首都阿斯塔纳，日常生活和政府办公都使用俄语，但在南部和西部地区，则哈萨克语更为普遍。\r\n用西里尔字母来书写哈萨克语，以及精英圈一直使用俄语，都是因为当年受到苏联统治。哈萨克斯坦许多邻国在1991年苏联解体后就立马不用西里尔字母了，阿塞拜疆1992年就开始用拉丁字母的教科书，土库曼斯坦是1993年。哈萨克斯坦的改变晚了近30年，经济环境变了，成本难以估算。\r\n\r\n\r\n                    新版的32个字母中只有23个在英语中也有。\r\n                \r\n目前根据官方媒体的说法，政府对这项将历时7年的项目预算约为2,180亿坚戈（合6.64亿美元），分三个阶段进行，当中90%将用于教育，出版新的拉丁字母教科书，包括文学课本。\r\n阿拉木图KIMEP大学教授、经济学家马杜马洛夫（Eldar Madumarov）说，官媒报道政府会在2018和2019每年投入约3亿坚戈（合92.2万美元）用于中小学教育的文字改变。\r\n今年还会开始翻译教学材料和教科书，全国的老师都要从2020年开始用新文字教学前班和一年级学生，此后每年增加一个年级，这样到2025年，从学前班到毕业班就都完成了过渡。\r\n\r\n\r\n                    新版的32个字母中只有23个在英语中也有。\r\n                \r\n还有约16.6万美元的预算用于在2018年第三季度开发IT程序，将西里尔文字转为拉丁文字，有3,320万美元用于提高中学老师的拉丁字母拼写水平，另有140万美元是在2024年请有影响力的博主为项目的第三阶段进行宣传。\r\n但政府并没有提供明细帐目，一些经济学家认为很难计算出这项浩大工程的直接成本。（我们请外交部、教育部和文化部部长就此评论或澄清，但均未获回应。）\r\n关于如何过渡的报道零零碎碎，有经济学家对不可预知的成本表示担心。\r\n马杜马洛夫说：\"这项改革如果操作不当，讲俄语的高端人才，包括哈萨克族人，考虑移民的可能性会很高，他们面临可能会丧失一些机会的风险。\"\r\n这个问题的严重程度在二月末暴露出来。本身精通俄语和哈萨克语的纳扎尔巴耶夫下令内阁会议全部使用哈萨克语。因为哈萨克国家事务一直用俄语，政府官员的俄语往往好过哈萨克语。一次电视转播的会议上看得出官员们表述很吃力，有些人甚至戴上了翻译耳机。\r\n\r\n\r\n                    2018年2月21日，哈萨克斯坦市级图书馆的工作人员在阿斯塔纳国家图书馆学习新字母。\r\n                \r\n改变政府事务的用语也有成本。身份证、护照、法律和规章的印刷文本——维持政府运行的一切文书都要翻译。卡斯帕洛夫（Kassymkhan Kapparov）在阿拉木图的哈萨克斯坦国家经济研究所担任所长，他表示这些项目虽然被规划在过渡期的第二和第三阶段，但却没有列明开支。\r\n更换护照和身份证本来就要收费，换护照大概60美元，换身份证是1.5美元。卡斯帕洛夫说：\"所以只需要在软件里改换字母就行了，政府没有列出这项开支，我认为是因为没有成本。\"\r\n他对计划于2024年启动的第三阶段最为好奇，这个阶段包括翻译中央和地方政府部门的内部商业文件，官方媒体也要开始使用新字母。\r\n卡斯帕洛夫说：\"官方媒体使用新字母首先要培训人员，然后要更改整个信息技术的基本架构，写入新字母，接着是改牌子（招牌）、信笺、图章还有标识，政府没有给出估算…我估计需要1,500到3,000万（美元）。\"\r\n这还只是用于公共部分的钱。\"私营部分肯定是自己买单，成本可能会加倍，也可能乘十倍，取决于政府有多强硬，譬如是否要求一年就改完。这有可能，我们的政府可很难说。\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Sa'biz把店名改成Sábiz大概要花3千美元。\r\n                \r\n卡斯帕洛夫还担心民众，尤其是老一辈读写新的拉丁文字会有困难，所以公共部门间的沟通可能需要同时使用几种语言。\r\n \"你可以称它为语言负担，当你在公共部门内部写封信，得用俄语、哈萨克语，以及新版文字拼写的哈萨克语来写，就得请人翻译，这就产生了额外花销和低效，预算中当然没列出来，但这肯定会给政府造成额外负担。\"\r\n卡斯帕洛夫对直接花费的估算很有信心，他在2007年首次可行性研究发布后对预算作过估计，以及今年1月官媒开始报道预算之后他再做预算分析。他预计整个过渡期的直接花费不超过10亿美元。\r\n但哈萨克斯坦宏观经济研究中心的所长胡代别尔格诺夫（Olzhas Khudaibergenov）则认为，花费将远低于卡斯帕洛夫的预估，文书类的成本会归入政府日常预算当中。\"真正用钱的只是为过渡期提供信息和解释的项目。\"\r\n \"我预计2018年到2025年每年的预算在20到30亿坚戈之间（合610万到920万美元）。\"\r\n卡斯帕洛夫认为政府向人民\"很难兜售\"这个字母过渡计划，投入也不会有直接回报。\r\n他说，\"更应该当成政府的一项社会和文化发展项目。\"\r\n胡代别尔格诺夫也同意。\"这更是一个民族身份的问题，我们在努力寻找自己的民族身份，也准备好要为之付出代价。\"\r\nKIMEP大学的马杜马洛夫教授认为，改变文字所带来的政治后果会拖缓经济。已经有人猜测纳扎尔巴耶夫这项决定是对俄关系冷淡的一个讯号，而且逐步转向拉丁文字也会弱化与后苏联国家的贸易关系。\r\n马杜马洛夫说，目前，俄罗斯、哈萨克斯坦和乌克兰之间10%的贸易得益于使用同一语言，语言相同又一定程度上造就了共同的文化和思维方式，讲俄语的哈萨克人在这三个国家间的经济流动能力更强。阿塞拜疆和格鲁吉亚人俄语不太流利，贸易联系就偏弱。\r\n\r\n\r\n                    俄语是哈萨克斯坦的城市通用语言，譬如首都阿斯塔纳。\r\n                \r\n相反，使用拉丁字母则能与西方大多数国家联系更紧密。譬如与欧盟结盟的土耳其，1928年从之前的阿拉伯文字转向了拉丁文字，本来还在谈判加入欧盟，但最近因为政府越来越专制以致谈判中断。\r\n寓居柏林的突厥语及突厥史专家凯尔乐-亨克勒（Barbara Kellner-Heinkele）说，大家一直都以土耳其为例，说明语言及法制体系的现代化如何使它获得了今日经济强国的地位。但她说这个进步主要归功于读写率的提高，以及共和国建国总统凯末尔（Ataturk）对社会各方面的严格管控。\r\n土耳其1928年改成拉丁文\"很快就完成了\"，但那个时候会读写的土耳其人寥寥可数，凯尔乐-亨克勒说，凯末尔需要本国受教育的人数水平与欧美相当， \"使用新字母也促进了教育\"。\r\n凯尔乐-亨克勒说到，与读写能力和经济相比，哈萨克斯坦的文字改革更重要的目的是要斩断与苏联的历史，\"要在政治上彰显独立，显示哈萨克斯坦是一个现代的国家，是一个民族国家。\"\r\n与政府一同创造新字母的语言学家穆拉基雅（Fazylzhanova Muratkyzy）也认可这个说法。她说，许多哈萨克人看西里尔文字会联想到苏联的统治。\r\n年轻人尤其欢迎这个改变。\r\n穆拉基雅说，她的的语言学研究所过去十年的研究显示，18到25岁的青年一代中，2007年支持换成拉丁文字的有47%，2016年增至80%。\r\n穆拉基雅说：\"这是人民的选择，国家的选择。新字母关乎我们的梦想与未来，标志着我们终于迎来了独立。\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    国家学术图书馆负责人达伦比柯夫纳（Munalbayeva Daurenbekovna）在阿斯塔纳国家图书馆讨论新字母。\r\n                \r\n达伦比柯夫纳是国家学术图书馆的负责人，她开办公开课，帮助图书馆人员和其他感兴趣的人掌握拉丁文字。她乐观地认为学习新文字对年轻人尤其不是问题。\r\n \"老师们每天上课要学一整月，但孩子只用10堂课，因为他们比成人学得快。\"\r\nSa'biz餐馆的店主埃皮耶夫全力支持弃用西里尔字母，无论这对他的小生意有多繁复。他说：\"我们想要连接欧美以及其他国家，更换字母能将让我们迎来新篇章。\"\r\n那么按照最新版字母把餐厅资料再改一遍，怎么样？\r\n埃皮耶夫想了一下说：\"先等等，等大家会读了再改。\"\r\n马克哈巴特·柯扎伯格诺瓦（Makhabbat
