"编辑:给力英语新闻  更新:2017年1月10日 作者:美国之音双语新闻(VOA News)\r\n美国星期一宣布制裁五名俄罗斯官员，美国国务院称他们为“臭名昭著的人权侵犯者”。\r\n这五个俄罗斯人是根据马格尼茨基人权问责法而被制裁的。\r\n虽然美国官员没有透露他们被制裁的具体原因，不过美国国务院发言人科比说：“制裁名单上每一个最近增加的人都经过了全面的调查。”\r\n科比说，这五名俄罗斯官员包括“在俄罗斯执法体系中压制政策的执行者，以及犯有臭名昭著的违反人权行为的个人。”\r\n他们当中包括压制异议人士的俄罗斯联邦调查委员会主席亚历山大.巴斯特雷金(Alexander Bastrykin)。\r\n被列入制裁名单人将不得进入美国，他们在美国的资产将被冻结。美国公民将不得与他们有任何金融往来。\r\n马格尼茨基人权问责法以俄罗斯反腐败律师谢尔盖.马格尼茨基命名。马格尼茨基在监狱中被关押一年后身体状况恶化于2009年去世。\r\n俄罗斯调查人员说马格尼茨基的死没有任何可疑之处。\r\n但是美国国务院认为有证据显示马格尼茨基在狱中被殴打，他的病没有得到及时治疗。\r\nThe U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia's top investigator and four other Kremlin figures Monday for what the State Department calls \"notorious human rights violations.\"\r\nThe five Russians, along with two other men with alleged ties to Hezbollah, were sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act.\r\nU.S. officials did not say exactly what the seven are being sanctioned for. But State Department spokesman John Kirby said, \"Each of the most recently added names was considered after extensive research.\"\r\nKirby said the five Russians played \"roles in the repressive machinery of Russia's law enforcement systems, as well as individuals involved in notorious human rights violations.\"\r\nThey include Alexander Bastrykin, who is believed to be the Kremlin's top investigator and leads the crackdown on dissenters.\r\nTwo others on the list are Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun, whom Britain has named as the two top suspects in the poisoning death of Russian spy and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in 2006.\r\nThe 44 people now on the list are barred from entering the United States and their U.S. assets are frozen. U.S. citizens are forbidden from carrying out any financial transactions with them.\r\nThe Magnitsky Act was named for Russian anti-corruption lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in 2009 after spending a year in prison and in poor health.\r\nRussian investigators ruled there was nothing criminal in Magnitsky's death.\r\nBut the State Department alleges there is plenty of evidence to show Magnitsky was beaten in his jail cell, and his illnesses went untreated."
