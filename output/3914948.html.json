With age, your skin thins and grows less elastic. As a result, wrinkles, age spots and skin tags become more common. Generally speaking, you can promote healthier skin by bathing in warm -- and not hot -- water. You should also wear sunscreen and not smoke.\nBut even if you've done everything right, there are some body parts that just seem destined to betray your age no matter what you do. We asked our Facebook friends what body part reveals their age. The most common responses? Neck, hands and face. We've put together a list of the six body parts that betray your age first -- with some helpful hints on how to keep yourself from looking too old, too fast. What do you think? Let us know in comments.\n1. Hands\nAlways exposed to the elements, your hands probably give away your age more than any other body part. Experts say sun damage is the biggest culprit. As a result, you should apply sunscreen to the backs of your hands, in addition to a good hand cream at least once a day. According to one expert, it's important to keep your hands well moisturized with thick creams -- particularly overnight. And the sooner you establish a daily regimen the better. Even though hands usually start looking older in one's 20s, most people don't recognize the signs of aging until their 30s or 40s, and most people won't start changing their routines until they notice the appearance of serious aging signs.\n2. Face\nFreckles may look adorable when you're a kid but dark spots on your face as you grow older are just, well, unattractive. But there is good news. There are ways to lighten your dark spots and brighten your skin tone. According to some experts, the easiest thing you can do to treat all types of hyper-pigmentation is to add abrightening serum to your regimen. In addition, try eating a diet that's good for your skin. When it comes to wrinkles, it may actually work to your disadvantage to be thin, oddly enough. Indeed one study from 2009 found that losing as little as 10 pounds can age a woman by four years.\n3. Eyelids\nAs you grow older, your eyelids will stretch and the muscles supporting them will grow weaker. Unfortunately, this can lead to a surplus of fat above and below your eyelids, creating unflattering bags under your eyes. \"My eyelids are melting and soon will hang in front of my eyes like little curtains,\" said one of our Facebook friends. Short of surgery, there are a few things you can do to help with this issue, including drinking more water, getting more sleep and consuming less salt. There also are a few creams on the market that many believe reduce puffiness.\n4. Neck Nora Ephron wasn't the only one worried about a turkey neck. \"The truly astonishing thing is how a body part can age 10 years almost overnight. My hands did. My neck seems to have collapsed in the space of a single year,\" said one post-50 friend. Indeed your neck often looks older before anything else because its skin is thinner than that on your face. Preventative measures such as the use of the same products you put on your face are a good idea -- so long as you do it before your neck has dramatically changed appearance. Makeup artist Bobbi Brown has offered some tips on hiding a turkey neck, such as wearing a nice scarf or a pretty blush that will draw attention away from your neck.\n5. Elbows\nUnfortunately, there's not a lot that can be done about the loose skin developing on your elbows. You can try using a moisturizer or cream -- or wearing long-sleeved shirts. Take comfort in the fact that you are not alone -- most people suffer from dry skin on their elbows as they age. To blame are the sun, stress, smoking, not enough liquids and the loss of sweat and oil glands.\n6. Hair\nNot only does your hair become thinner and grayer with age, but it also becomes more dry and brittle. Experts say you can add moisture to your hair by using certain oils. You can also give your strands some TLC by scrapping harsh chemicals and trying protein-rich hair treatments instead.\n 查看译文\n我们都渴望从中找到一个平衡点――一方面能够优雅地老去，另一方面又希望自己看上去比实际年龄小。随着年岁的增长，肌肤不再紧致，皱纹，老年斑，皮肤松弛等一系列问题也找上门来。一般来说，我们可以通过洗温水澡来改善肌肤问题。注意，是温水，而不是热水。当然，涂抹防晒霜，杜绝吸烟也是必不可少的。\n可是，无论我们多么注重保养，身体上总有一些部位会暴露我们的年龄，脸谱网上的一项调查显示，在网友们认为最能暴露年龄的身体部位中，排名靠前的是颈部，双手和面部。我们把暴露年龄的六大身体部位列成一份清单，并附上小贴士帮助你延缓衰老。你们觉得怎样？一起来看看吧。\n1. 双手\n我们的双手由于长期暴露在外，因而比其他任何部位都更容易泄漏实际年龄。专家表示，光损害（sun damage）才是罪魁祸首。因此，除了每天至少涂一次护手霜，别忘了还要在手背上涂抹防晒霜。据一位专家介绍，大量使用护手霜能够达到手部保湿的效果，尤其是在夜间。而且越早确立养生法则就越有益。事实上，在我们20多岁的时候，双手就逐渐显示出衰老的迹象。然而，大部分人一直到三四十岁才意识到这一问题的严重性，并且往往等问题发展到不可逆的时候，才想着要改变不规律的生活习惯。\n2.面部\n同样是斑，长在小朋友脸上似乎很萌，要是长在大人脸上，就不那么美观了。别担心，我来给你支招，帮助你淡化色斑，亮白肌肤。据专家介绍，针对各类黑色素沉着最简单的解决办法就是使用亮白精华液。此外，合理饮食对改善肤质也大有裨益。谈起令人闻之色变的皱纹，说来也怪，越瘦的人皱纹越多。2009年的一项研究发现，体重减轻10磅能够让女性朋友看上去比实际年龄小4岁。\n3.眼睑\n年龄的增长使得眼睑周围的肌肤变得松弛，失去弹性。过多的脂肪堆积在眼睑部位便形成了影响美观的眼袋。脸谱网上的一位网友抱怨说：“我的眼皮下垂得厉害，就像窗帘一样挡在我眼前。”其实，无需手术，只要多喝水，保证充足的睡眠，摄入尽可能少的盐，也有助于改善眼部肌肤问题。市面上也有出售一些效果不错的眼霜。\n4.颈部\n饱受“火鸡脖”（a turkey neck，由于颈部皮肤松弛下垂而形成的索条状皱纹，因类似于火鸡的脖子而得名）困扰的可不止诺拉伊弗龙（Nora Ephron）一个人。这位50多岁的网友说：“最可怕的是一个身体部位的变化竟然在一夜之间让你看上去老了10岁。我的手就是这样。我的脖子在过去一年间也看得出衰老的痕迹。确实，由于颈部皮肤比面部皮肤还要细嫩，因此，颈部就成了年龄的第二体征。在颈部使用和面部一样的护肤品当然是个好方法，前提是你不能等到颈部皮肤变差以后才“亡羊补牢”。化妆师波什・布朗（Bobbi Brown）教你如何遮挡“火鸡脖”――戴上一条好看的围巾，或是想办法将别人的注意力从你的颈部转移到面部。\n5.手肘\n没有什么好办法能够对付肘部皮肤干燥问题真是遗憾。使用润肤霜，精华霜，或者干脆穿长袖吧。不过可以释怀的是你不是一个越长大肘部皮肤越干燥的人，事实上大多数人都是如此。日晒，压力，吸烟，水喝得不够以及汗留得过多都会造成肘部皮肤干燥。\n6．头发\n岁数的增长在给我们带来白头发以及脱发问题的同时，也使发质变得干枯脆弱。专家表示，使用护发精油有助于头发保湿。同时，用富含蛋白质的h油产品取代含刺激性化学物质的护发产品，给你的秀发带去多一层呵护。"
