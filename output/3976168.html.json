It's just that over-the-top gifts and parties may not be feasible on a budget.\n　　她真正想要的是能够有一段停止做通常的杂务而且能够和家人一起度过的美好的时间。\n　　And speaking as a mom, I can say that what matters most to me on Mother's Day isn't the amount of money spent (in fact, I get more of a kick out of saving money, usually). What makes Mother's Day special to me is two things: getting a free pass out of normal mom work like laundry, cleaning, cooking and the like, and getting to spend time with my family. Peruse the list below for plenty of ideas that won't cost you but will still make your mom feel special. (See also: \"Mother's Day gifts that show you really care.\")\n　　就一个母亲而言，我可以说母亲节上在我看来更多的麻烦并不是大量的花费(事实上，通常我更多的并没有省钱)。对于我来说母亲节的特殊在于两件事情：母亲们可以从普通妈妈的工作中解脱出来像洗衣服，打扫，做饭等，还有和家人一起度过一段时间。阅读下面列表中的不花钱但是仍你能是母亲感到特殊的大量的观点。(也能使你明白：“母亲节的礼物展示给你真正的关心。”)\n　　Give Mom the day off.\n　　给妈妈一天的假期。\n　　This should be the absolute minimum you do to celebrate Mother's Day, anyway: Give her a day off from all the mundane stuff she does, without complaining, day after day. Pitch in, get the whole family involved, and do the work for her.\n　　这绝对应该是你为庆祝母亲节所做的最小的事，无论如何：在她们，日复一日的没有完成家务的情况下，从所有她正在做的家务中给妈妈一天的休息时间。\n　　Take the kids to the park and give Mom some quiet time.\n　　带孩子去公园而且给妈妈一些安静的时间。\n　　Listen, I know a mom loves being with her kids but, especially for moms of young kids, having a little peace and quiet time is truly one of the ultimate gifts you can give. Pack up the kids, go to the park for an hour or two, and leave Mom at home to nap, watch a movie in peace, read a book, or do her nails -- whatever she wants.\n　　听，我知道妈妈喜欢跟她的孩子们一起，尤其是妈妈的年幼的孩子们，有一个小的和平与安静的时间真的是一个你可以给的的礼物。带上孩子们，去公园一或两个小时，让妈妈在家里睡觉，看电影，在和平年代，读一本书，或做指甲――无论她想要什么。\n　　Make and deliver breakfast in bed.\n　　为母亲做并且向她提供在床上吃早饭。\n　　Yes, it's as cliched as giving Dad a tie for Father's Day, but there's a good reason here. Moms are usually the ones who hop (or crawl) out of bed and get everybody going in the morning. She deserves a break. Make a nice breakfast, deliver it to her in bed, and let her enjoy a morning off. (Post continues below.)\n　　是的，它就像父亲节送给爸爸一条领带似的陈词滥调，但是在这里它是一个好的原因。妈妈们通常是这样一个人：她每天早上第一个从床上跳下来或爬下来，给家里的每个人做好饭。她值得我们为她做这样一顿早饭。做一顿美味的早餐，送给仍在床上的母亲，然后让她享受一顿早饭的时间来休息。(这以后下面继续。)\n　　Take the family out for a picnic at the park.\n　　带全家人去公园野炊。\n　　Get in the kitchen and make some sandwiches, pasta salad, or some other portable meal. Gather up all the picnic supplies (try not to ask Mom what you should take). Then whisk everybody away to a local park for a picnic and some play time outdoors. Take a walk, sit around, talk to people, play volleyball, or go at night and watch the stars. Mom's choice.\n　　去厨房然后做一些三明治 通心粉沙拉，或一些其他的便携式餐。收集所有的野餐用品(尝试这不问妈妈你说应该带的东西)。然后带着大家到当地的公园野餐而且给大家一些户外游玩时间。散步，大家坐在一起，和人们聊天，打排球或在晚上看星星。这是妈妈的选择。"
