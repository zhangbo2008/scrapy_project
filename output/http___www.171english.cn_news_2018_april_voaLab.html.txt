It was taken out of service in 2016. \r\n\r\n涓浗鐨勨�滃ぉ瀹竴鍙封�濋暱12绫筹紝閲嶉噺涓�8.5鍚�\r\n\r\n涓浗涓�涓簾寮冧笉鐢ㄧ殑澶┖绌洪棿绔欐槦鏈熶竴鏃╂櫒璧板畬鍏跺鍛芥渶鍚庝竴绋嬶紝鍏剁鐗囧潬钀藉埌鍗楀お骞虫磱銆�\r\n涓浗杞戒汉鑸ぉ宸ョ▼鍔炲叕瀹よ锛屼腑鍥藉ぉ瀹竴鍙风殑澶ч儴鍒嗗湪澶ф皵灞備腑鐑ф瘉銆�\r\n鍦ㄥ潬钀借繃绋嬩腑娌℃湁鐑ф瘉鐨勯儴鍒嗚惤鍒版捣闈㈡椂娌℃湁閫犳垚浠讳綍鎹熷け銆�\r\n澶╁涓�鍙峰潬钀界┛杩囧ぇ姘斿眰鐨勬椂闂村ぇ绾︿负涓や釜灏忔椂銆�\r\n鏃╁厛鐨勯娴嬭锛屽皢浼氭湁涓�浜涘皬鐨勬湭鐑ф瘉閮ㄤ欢鍧犺惤鍒板崡澶цタ娲嬶紝瀵瑰湴闈㈢殑浜烘瀯鎴愰潪甯稿皬鐨勫▉鑳併��\r\n澶╁涓�鍙风殑浣撶Н涓庝竴杈嗗ぇ宸磋溅鐩镐技锛岄噸閲忎负8.5鍚ㄣ��\r\n澶╁涓�鍙锋槸10骞存潵鍧犺惤鍒板湴鐞冨ぇ姘斿眰鐨勬渶澶т汉閫犵墿銆�\r\n澶╁涓�鍙蜂簬2011骞村彂灏勶紝浣滀负涓浗澶┖閫犱汉椋炶浣跨敤鐨勭┖闂寸珯銆傜┖闂寸珯瀵垮懡琚甯冪粓缁撳悗锛屼腑鍥�2016骞村簾寮冧簡杩欎釜绌洪棿绔欍��"
