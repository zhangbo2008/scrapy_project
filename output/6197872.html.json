"Our strongest personality traits can be deduced simply from ourfacial features, scientists believe.\n　　科学家认为，他人能够通过我们的面部特征轻易推算出我们最显著的人格特质。\n　　Research shows those with higher IQs are usually good-looking,while those with wider faces are usually perceived as being morepowerful and successful.\n　　研究显示，智商高的人通常面容姣好，面部较宽的人则通常被认为更有权、更成功。\n　　There is even evidence that sexual deviancy can be picked up from facial features, withpaedophiles more likely to have minor facial flaws.\n　　甚至有证据证明能够通过面部特点看出性癖异常，有恋童癖的人更可能有不太严重的面部缺陷。\n　　The new evidence means the judgments we make when we meet strangers - which is usuallyconcluded in less than a tenth of a second - are often accurate.\n　　这项新的证据意味着我们遇到陌生人时做出的判断――这种判断通常在十分之一秒内就完成了――常常是准确的。\n　　Mark Fetscherin, professor of international business at Rollins College, Florida, has recently found alink between company profits and the shape of its chief executive's face.\n　　佛罗里达州罗林斯学院的国际商贸学教授马克・费斯凯林(Mark Fetscherin)近期发现公司利润和首席执行官的脸型之间存在联系。\n　　In his new book, CEO Branding, Mr Fetscherin describes how the executive tended to have widerfaces than the average male.\n　　在他的新书《CEO Branding》中，费斯凯林先生描述了高级主管的脸颊通常比正常男性更宽。\n　　A wider face means that the person is viewed as dominant and successful, Mr Fetscherin said. Healso found a positive link between that shape face and the profits of the company.\n　　费斯凯林先生说：“更宽的脸颊意味着这个人看起来更有权势、更成功。”他还发现了宽脸和公司利润之间的正比联系。\n　　He told The Sunday Times: 'Facial width-to-height ratio correlates with real world measures ofaggressive and ambitious behavior and is associated with a psychological sense of power.'\n　　他告诉周日泰晤士报(The Sunday Times)：“脸的宽高比例与真实世界对攻击性行为和有野心的行为的衡量标准存在相关性，与心理上的权力感也有关联。”\n　　British researchers found a similar result when they analysed the results of FTSE chief executives.\n　　英国研究人员在分析富时指数公司(FTSE)高管的业绩时也得出了相似的研究结果。\n　　Jamie Ward, professor of psychology and his co-author Shuaa Alrajih, suggested the underlyingfactor was high levels of testosterone, which is linked to aggression and the pursuit ofdominance. Testosterone can also influence bone and muscle structure.\n　　心理学教授杰米・沃德(Jamie Ward)以及他的合著者舒阿・阿尔拉吉(Shuaa Alrajih)认为其潜在因素是高水平的睾丸激素，这种激素与攻击性以及追求控制权有关。睾丸激素还能影响骨骼和肌肉构造\n　　A typical example might be advertising agency boss Martin Sorrell, who runs WPP, and sportsmensuch as Vinnie Jones.\n　　一个典型的例子可能是WPP广告公司的老板马丁・索瑞尔(Martin Sorrell)以及运动员，比如说维尼・琼斯(Vinnie Jones)。\n　　Elsewhere, scientists also believe people can decipher negative attributes from a person's face. AtCornell University, scientists showed subjects mugshots of those who were guilty and innocentand found the majority could tell them apart.\n　　另外，科学家还认为人们能够从一个人的脸上辨认出不好的品性。美国康奈尔大学(CornellUniversity)的科学家们向研究对象展示了一些罪犯和无罪的人的面部照片，发现大多数人能够将他们区别开来。\n　　Researchers have also found that those with a high IQ tend to be better looking.\n　　研究人员还发现高智商的人通常颜值也高。\n　　An example is Kate Beckinsale, who won poetry awards as a teenager, then studied Russianliterature and English at Oxford.\n　　以凯特・贝金赛尔(Kate Beckinsale)为例，她十几岁就获得了诗歌方面的奖项，后来到牛津大学学习俄罗斯文学及英语。\n　　Actress Natalie Portman also graduated with a psychology degree from Havard in 2003.\n　　还有女演员娜塔莉・波特曼(Natalie Portman)，她2003年毕业于哈佛大学，获心理学学士学位。\n　　Leslie Zebrowitz, professor of social relations at Brandeis University, near Boston, said the trendwas due to the high quality of DNA, with few mutations, that those people have inherited.\n　　莱斯利・泽布维兹(Leslie Zebrowitz)是位于波士顿附近的布莱迪思大学(Brandeis University)的社会关系学教授，她表示，这一趋势是因为这些人继承了基本没有突变的优质DNA。"
