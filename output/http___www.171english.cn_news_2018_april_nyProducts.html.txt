"China Slaps Tariffs on U.S. Products in Warning Shot to Trump\r\nBEIJING 鈥� The Chinese government hit back Monday at President Trump鈥檚 tariffs on steel and aluminum by acting on a threat to put tariffs as high as 25 percent on imports of 128 American-made products, including pork and seamless steel pipes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Ministry of Commerce indicated that the tariffs, which it first publicly suggested almost two weeks ago, were intended to pressure the Trump administration to back down from a simmering trade war. In addition to imposing additional tariffs on steel and aluminum from China and other countries, President Trump has threatened to put protective duties on other Chinese-made products worth $60 billion.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淲e hope that the United States will rescind its measures that violate World Trade Organization rules as quickly as possible,鈥� the ministry said in an online statement about China鈥檚 retaliatory tariffs. 鈥淐hina and the United States are the world鈥檚 two biggest economies, and cooperation is the only correct choice. Both sides should use dialogue and consultation to resolve their mutual concerns.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese retaliation was no surprise. But Beijing appeared to go a step beyond its initial threat last month to counter the United States鈥� tariffs on steel and aluminum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Commerce said then that it could impose tariffs in two stages: first, a 15 percent duty on 120 products, including fruit and wine, and then, after further assessing the impact of the United States鈥� tariffs, a 25 percent tariff on eight other products, including pork, an important moneymaker, especially in farming regions in states that voted for Mr. Trump.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the latest announcement said the tariffs that will take effect on Monday covered all 128 products, including the 25 percent charge on pork.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ministry said it had Chinese public opinion on its side after asking for views about the trade measures. Over recent weeks, China鈥檚 state-run news media has condemned the Trump administration鈥檚 protectionist steps and presented China as the innocent defender of open trade. In fact, China imposes relatively high barriers on many imports and on foreign investment in many sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淢any members of the public voiced their support for the measures and the product list through telephone calls, emails and other means,鈥� the ministry said. 鈥淎fter an assessment, it was decided to implement the measures described on 128 products imported from the United States.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Trump鈥檚 threatened tariffs on $60 billion worth of other Chinese-made products are likely to prompt more retaliation from China, which could single out more valuable American exports such as soybeans and hurt Apple and other companies that rely heavily on Chinese consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiu He, a Chinese vice premier and economic adviser to President Xi Jinping, told Steven Mnuchin, the American treasury secretary, in a phone call just more than a week ago that the two countries should 鈥渟tay rational and work together to maintain the overall stability of their economic and trade relations.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has been visiting Beijing, said on Saturday that Chinese officials she met, including Mr. Liu, 鈥渉ave not deviated from their talking points鈥� about the Trump administration鈥檚 tariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淎merica is waking up to the loss of its technological advantage through China鈥檚 restrictions on access to its internal markets,鈥� she told reporters. 鈥淭hat is now a place where policy is beginning to change.鈥�\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�2鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛堝偍鐧句寒锛�\r\n鍖椾含鈥斺�斾腑鍥芥斂搴滃懆涓�鍏戠幇鏃╁墠鐨勫▉鑳侊紝瀹ｅ竷瀵瑰寘鎷尓鑲夊拰鏃犵紳閽㈢鍦ㄥ唴鐨�128绉嶅師浜х編鍥界殑杩涘彛鍟嗗搧鍔犲緛鏈�楂樿揪25%鐨勫叧绋庯紝浠ユ鍙嶅嚮鐗规湕鏅�荤粺瀵归挗閾佸拰閾濆緛鏀跺叧绋庛��\r\n\r\n\r\n涓浗鍟嗗姟閮ㄧО锛岃繖浜涘叧绋庢剰鍦ㄥ悜鐗规湕鏅斂搴滄柦鍘嬶紝杩娇鍏舵斁寮冧竴瑙﹀嵆鍙戠殑璐告槗鎴樸�傝繎涓ゅ懆鍓嶏紝涓浗鍟嗗姟閮ㄩ娆″叕寮�寤鸿寰佹敹涓婅堪鍏崇◣銆傞櫎浜嗗涓浗鍜屽彟涓�浜涘浗瀹剁殑閽㈤搧鍜岄摑寰佹敹棰濆鍏崇◣澶栵紝鐗规湕鏅�荤粺杩樺▉鑳佽瀵瑰叾浠栦环鍊�600浜跨編鍏冿紙绾﹀悎3800浜垮厓浜烘皯甯侊級鐨勪腑鍥藉埗閫犱骇鍝佸緛鏀朵繚鎶ゆ�у叧绋庛��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滃笇鏈涚編鏂瑰敖蹇挙閿�杩濆弽涓栬锤缁勭粐瑙勫垯鐨勬帾鏂斤紝鈥濅腑鍥藉晢鍔￠儴鍦ㄧ綉涓婁竴浠芥湁鍏充腑鍥藉緛鏀舵姤澶嶆�у叧绋庣殑澹版槑涓銆傗�滀腑缇庝綔涓轰笘鐣屼笂涓や釜鏈�澶х殑缁忔祹浣擄紝鍚堜綔鏄敮涓�姝ｇ‘鐨勯�夋嫨銆傚弻鏂瑰簲閫氳繃瀵硅瘽鍗忓晢瑙ｅ喅褰兼鍏冲垏銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n涓浗鐨勬姤澶嶅湪鎰忔枡涔嬩腑銆備絾鍖椾含姝や妇浼间箮瓒呭嚭浜嗕笂鏈堜负瀵规姉缇庡浗瀵归挗閾佸拰閾濆緛鏀跺叧绋庤�屽彂鍑虹殑鏈�鍒濆▉鑳併��\r\n\r\n\r\n2014骞达紝鑹惧ゥ鐡﹀窞鐨勪竴搴у吇鐚満銆備腑鍥藉皢瀵圭編鍥界尓鑲夊緛鏀�25%鐨勫叧绋庯紝鍦ㄦ姇绁ㄧ粰鐗规湕鏅偅浜涘窞鐨勫啘涓氬湴鍖猴紝鍏荤尓涓氭槸涓�涓噸瑕佺殑缁忔祹鏉ユ簮銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n涓浗鍟嗗姟閮ㄥ綋鏃惰〃绀哄皢鍒嗕袱涓樁娈靛緛鏀跺叧绋庯細棣栧厛瀵瑰寘鎷按鏋滃拰钁¤悇閰掑湪鍐呯殑120绉嶄骇鍝佸姞寰�15%鐨勫叧绋庯紝鐒跺悗锛屽湪瀵圭編鍥藉叧绋庡甫鏉ョ殑褰卞搷杩涜璇勪及鍚庯紝鍐嶅鍖呮嫭鐚倝鍦ㄥ唴鐨勫彟澶栧叓绉嶄骇鍝佸姞寰�25%鐨勫叧绋庛�傜尓鑲夋槸缇庡浗閲嶈鐨勮禋閽变骇鍝侊紝鐗瑰埆鏄湪鏀寔鐗规湕鏅殑鍚勫窞鐨勫啘涓氬尯銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗘渶鏂板０鏄庣О锛屽皢浜庡懆涓�鐢熸晥鐨勫叧绋庢兜鐩栧叏閮�128绉嶄骇鍝侊紝鍖呮嫭瀵圭尓鑲夊姞寰�25%鐨勫叧绋庛��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍟嗗姟閮ㄧО锛屽湪瀵圭浉鍏宠锤鏄撴帾鏂藉緛姹傛剰瑙佸悗锛屽畠寰楀埌浜嗕腑鍥芥皯浼楃殑鏀寔銆傛渶杩戝嚑鍛紝涓浗瀹樻柟鏂伴椈濯掍綋璋磋矗鐗规湕鏅斂搴滅殑淇濇姢涓讳箟涓炬帾锛屽苟鎶婁腑鍥借鎴愭槸鏃犺緶鐨勫紑鏀捐锤鏄撴崓鍗�呫�傚疄闄呬笂锛屼腑鍥藉寰堝杩涘彛浜у搧鍜岃澶氶鍩熺殑澶栧浗鎶曡祫璁剧疆浜嗙浉瀵硅緝楂樼殑澹佸瀿銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滃ぇ閲忔皯浼楅�氳繃鐢佃瘽銆佺數瀛愰偖浠剁瓑鏂瑰紡锛屽鎺柦鍙婁骇鍝佹竻鍗曡〃绀烘敮鎸侊紝鈥濅腑鍥藉晢鍔￠儴璇淬�傗�滅粡杩囪瘎浼帮紝鍐冲畾瀵硅嚜缇庤繘鍙ｇ殑128椤逛骇鍝佸疄鏂戒笂杩版帾鏂姐�傗�� \r\n\r\n\r\n鐗规湕鏅▉鑳佽瀵逛环鍊�600浜跨編鍏冪殑鍏朵粬涓浗浜у搧寰佹敹鍏崇◣锛岃繖鍙兘浼氫績浣夸腑鍥介噰鍙栨洿澶氭姤澶嶈鍔ㄣ�備腑鍥藉彲鑳戒細鎸戝嚭澶ц眴绛夋洿閲嶈鐨勭編鍥藉嚭鍙ｅ晢鍝侊紝骞舵墦鍑昏嫻鏋�(Apple)鍜屽彟澶栦竴浜涗弗閲嶄緷璧栦腑鍥芥秷璐硅�呯殑鍏徃銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n灏卞湪涓�鍛ㄥ涔嬪墠锛屼腑鍥藉壇鎬荤悊銆佷腑鍥藉浗瀹朵富甯範杩戝钩鐨勭粡娴庨【闂垬楣ゅ湪鐢佃瘽涓缇庡浗璐㈡斂閮ㄩ暱鍙茶拏鏂嚶峰姫閽�(Steven Mnchin)琛ㄧず锛屽笇鏈涗袱鍥解�滀繚鎸佺悊鎬э紝鍏卞悓鍔姏锛岀淮鎶や腑缇庣粡璐稿叧绯绘�讳綋绋冲畾鐨勫ぇ灞�鈥濄��\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗕竴鐩村湪鍖椾含璁块棶鐨勯┈钀ㄨ濉炲窞姘戜富鍏氬弬璁憳浼婁附鑾庣櫧路娌冧鸡(Elizabeth Warren)鍛ㄥ叚琛ㄧず锛屽悓濂逛細闈㈢殑涓浗瀹樺憳锛屽寘鎷垬楣わ紝鍦ㄧ壒鏈楁櫘鏀垮簻寰佹敹鍏崇◣涓�浜嬩笂鈥滄病鏈夊亸绂讳粬浠嚜宸辩殑璇磋緸銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滅編鍥芥剰璇嗗埌锛屽洜涓轰腑鍥藉杩涘叆鍏跺浗鍐呭競鍦虹殑闄愬埗锛岀編鍥藉け鍘讳簡鎶�鏈紭鍔匡紝鈥濆ス瀵硅鑰呰銆傗�滄墍浠ワ紝鐜板湪杩欐柟闈㈢殑鏀跨瓥寮�濮嬫敼鍙樹簡銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍌ㄧ櫨浜�(Chris Buckley)鏄�婄航绾︽椂鎶ャ�嬮┗浜鑰呫��\r\n\r\n\r\nSteven Lee Myers瀵规湰鏂囨湁鎶ラ亾璐＄尞銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氱航绾︽椂鎶ヤ腑鏂囩綉"
