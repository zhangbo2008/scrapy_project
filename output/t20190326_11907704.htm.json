The country will never allow the forced transfer of technology and will resolutely crack down on all kinds of IPR infringements in accordance with the law, so as to create an international, market-oriented and rule-based business environment.\n　　The representatives expressed their confidence in the Chinese market, saying they will expand trade and investment in China so as to better share the opportunities of the country's development."
