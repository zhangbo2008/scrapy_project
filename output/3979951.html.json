About seven hours later, one of the volunteers spotted the golden retriever-german shepherd mix near a knoll; Carson was huddled underneath the pup. It appears the dog protected the missing boy from a thunderstorm by using his body to shield him.\n　　Carson Urness今年3岁，周一晚上7点30分左右他从自家庭院里失踪，此后一个由约200人组成的大队开始了搜寻工作。7小时后，有个志愿者在一座小丘附近发现了一条金毛和德牧的混种狗，而Carson正被它拥在身下。看上去这条忠狗在雷暴雨中用自己的身体保护了它的小主人。\n　　\"You think of the worst, but then I knew Cooper was gone. If anyone was going to find him, they'd just have to find Cooper,\" Carson's mother told WDAZ-TV.\n　　“一开始我们想到了最糟糕的情况，但随后我发现Cooper也不在。如果我们想找到Carson，只要找到Cooper就行。”Carson的母亲对WDAZ电视台说。\n　　The boy and his dog were discovered about a mile away from the family's Cooperstown farm. Though those on foot were called off from the search around 2 a.m. Tuesday due to heavy rain, ATV riders continued until one four-wheeler spotted the dog.\n　　男孩和狗是在距离自家农场一英里的地方被找到的。虽然由于周二凌晨2点左右下起了暴雨，搜寻工作被喊暂停，但还是有些志愿者开着沙滩车继续寻找，直到其中一人发现了Cooper。\n　　As Carson rode back to the family home on the ATV, Cooper reportedly followed closely behind. The 3-year-old was taken to a local hospital for evaluation but appears to be in good shape after the ordeal, thanks to his loyal dog.\n　　据报道，在人们用沙滩车将Carson载回家时，Cooper一路紧跟其后。Carson被送进一家当地医院进行检查，但是多亏有忠诚的狗狗守护，他在历经磨难后安然无恙。"
