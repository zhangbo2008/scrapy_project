"The health of a nation鈥檚 economy and the health of its people are connected, but in some surprising ways. At times like these, when the economy is strong and unemployment is low, research has found that death rates rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least, in the short term. In the long term, economic growth is good for health. What鈥檚 going on?\r\n\r\n\r\nOne study of European countries just before and during the Great Recession found that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 0.5 percent decline in the overall mortality rate. Other studies of Europe during different periods, as well as those of the United States, found a similar relationship between joblessness and mortality.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is counterintuitive, since economic growth is a major factor in higher living standards. When the economy is more productive, we have more resources to promote health and well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a surging economy does more than generate greater income. An industrial economy also pumps out more air pollution as more goods are produced. Polluted air, it turns out, is a major contributor to the mortality-increasing effect of an economic boom. In their analysis of how economic growth increases mortality, David Cutler and Wei Huang, of Harvard University, and Adriana Lleras-Muney, of U.C.L.A., found that two-thirds of the effect can be attributed to air pollution alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt鈥檚 a different story with agricultural economies. The Cutler, Huang and Lleras-Muney study, published as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, found that mortality rates fall when such economies are growing. Before 1945, when agriculture was more dominant in the U.S. economy, growth was not associated with rising mortality either.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther research published in the journal Health Economics supports the pollution hypothesis. In their analysis of the Great Recession in Europe, Jos茅 Tapia Granados of Drexel University and Edward Ionides of the University of Michigan found that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a one percent lower mortality rate for respiratory illnesses, as well as reductions in mortality for cardiovascular disease and heart conditions, which are known to be sensitive to air pollution. In countries where the recession was more severe 鈥� the Baltic States, Spain, Greece and Slovenia 鈥� respiratory disease mortality fell 16 percent during 2007-2010, compared with just a 3.2 percent decline in the four years preceding the recession.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther factors contribute to rising mortality during expansions. Occupational hazards and stress can directly harm health through work. Some studies find that alcohol and tobacco consumption increases during booms, too. Both are associated with higher death rates. Also, employed people drive more, increasing mortality from auto accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring recessions, people without jobs may have more time to sleep and exercise and may eat more healthfully. One study found that higher unemployment is associated with lower rates of obesity, increased physical activity and a better diet. On the other hand, suicides increase during economic downturns.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome recent work suggests that economic booms may have become less deadly and busts more so in recent years. This could be a result of less polluting production in modern, expanding economies, or of better medical care for those with conditions sensitive to pollution. Safer roads and cars, and less driving under the influence of alcohol and other substances, could also play a role.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚t鈥檚 also possible that opioids and other drugs may have made recessions more harmful to health than they used to be,鈥� Mr. Cutler said.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther analysis shows that although smaller economic booms increase mortality, larger ones decrease it. Japan鈥檚 economic booms in the 1960s and 1970s are associated with longer life spans there, for example. Serious and lengthy downturns 鈥� like the Great Depression 鈥� are associated with shorter lives, even as smaller ones lengthen them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWealthier nations are healthier nations, an effect seen across generations. People in their formative years 鈥� children and teenagers 鈥� are particularly sensitive to the economic environment. Conditions in utero can have lasting health and economic effects. Graduating from college during a recession can depress one鈥檚 earnings for a decade. People growing up during a strong economy are more likely to have access to resources and to develop skills and opportunities that promote health. These benefits can last a lifetime, increasing longevity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn total, there鈥檚 little question that long-term economic growth broadly improves the human condition. But not everyone enjoys the gains equally. In the short run, economic expansions can cut short the lives of some.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�3鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圓USTIN FRAKT锛�\r\n涓�涓浗瀹剁殑缁忔祹鍋ュ悍涓庡叾浜烘皯鐨勫仴搴锋槸瀛樺湪鐫�鑱旂郴鐨勶紝浣嗗叧鑱旂殑鏂瑰紡鏈夌潃浠や汉鎯婅涔嬪銆傚湪鍍忕洰鍓嶈繖绉嶆椂鏈燂紝缁忔祹寮哄姴銆佸け涓氱巼浣庯紝鐮旂┒鍗村彂鐜帮紝姝讳骸鐜囧湪涓婂崌銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鑷冲皯鍦ㄧ煭鏈熷唴鏄繖鏍枫�備粠闀胯繙鏉ョ湅锛岀粡娴庡闀垮鍋ュ悍鏈夌泭銆傝繖鏄�庝箞鍥炰簨鍛紵\r\n\r\n\r\n涓�椤瑰娆ф床鍥藉鐨勭爺绌跺彂鐜帮紝鍦ㄧ粡娴庡ぇ琛伴��涔嬪墠涓庤“閫�鏈熼棿锛屽け涓氱巼涓婂崌涓�涓櫨鍒嗙偣涓庢暣浣撴浜＄巼涓嬮檷0.5%鍛堢浉鍏冲叧绯汇�傚叾浠栧娆ф床鐨勪笉鍚屾椂鏈熴�佷互鍙婄編鍥藉湪閭ｄ簺鏃舵湡鐨勭爺绌跺湪澶变笟鐜囧拰姝讳骸鐜囦箣闂村彂鐜颁簡绫讳技鐨勫叧绯汇��\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欐湁杩濆父鐞嗭紝鍥犱负缁忔祹澧為暱鏄彁楂樼敓娲绘按骞崇殑涓昏鍥犵礌銆傚綋缁忔祹鐨勭敓浜у姏鏇撮珮鏃讹紝鎴戜滑鏈夋洿澶氱殑璧勬簮鏉ユ彁鍗囧仴搴峰拰瀹変箰銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗙粡娴庣殑蹇�熷闀夸笉浠呬粎甯︽潵浜嗘洿楂樼殑鏀跺叆銆傚伐涓氱粡娴庡湪鐢熶骇鏇村鍟嗗搧鐨勫悓鏃讹紝涔熷埗閫犵潃鏇村鐨勭┖姘旀薄鏌撱�備簨瀹炶瘉鏄庯紝鍙楁薄鏌撶殑绌烘皵锛屾槸绻佽崳缁忔祹浣撳嚭鐜版浜＄巼澧為暱鏁堝簲鐨勪富瑕佸洜绱犮�傚湪瀵圭粡娴庡闀垮浣曟彁楂樻浜＄巼鐨勫垎鏋愪腑锛屽搱浣涘ぇ瀛︾殑鎴寸淮路鍗＄壒鍕�(David Cutler)鍜岄粍鐐溿�佷互鍙婂姞宸炲ぇ瀛︽礇鏉夌煻鍒嗘牎鐨勯樋寰烽噷浜氬路闆峰嫆鏂�-绌嗗Ξ(Adriana Lleras-Muney)鍙戠幇锛岃繖绉嶆晥搴旀湁涓夊垎涔嬩簩閮芥槸绌烘皵姹℃煋閫犳垚鐨勩��\r\n\r\n\r\n寰峰厠钀ㄦ柉宸炲笗钀ㄨ开绾崇殑鐐兼补鍘傘�傞殢鐫�宸ヤ笟鍖栧浗瀹剁殑缁忔祹鎰堝彂绻佽崳锛屼篃浜х敓鏇村鐨勭┖姘旀薄鏌擄紝缂╃煭浜嗕竴浜涗汉鐨勫鍛姐��\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欐槸涓�涓笌鍐滀笟缁忔祹浣撴埅鐒朵笉鍚岀殑鏁呬簨銆傚崱鐗瑰嫆銆侀粍鐐滃拰闆峰嫆鏂�-绌嗗Ξ鐨勭爺绌剁敱缇庡浗鍏ㄥ浗缁忔祹鐮旂┒鎵�浠ュ伐浣滄姤鍛婄殑褰㈠紡鍙戣〃锛屼粬浠殑鐮旂┒鍙戠幇锛屽湪鍐滀笟缁忔祹浣撳闀挎椂锛屾浜＄巼鏈夋墍涓嬮檷銆�1945骞翠互鍓嶏紝褰撳啘涓氬湪缇庡浗缁忔祹涓崰涓诲鍦颁綅鏃讹紝缁忔祹澧為暱涓庢浜＄巼涓婂崌涔熶笉瀛樺湪鍏宠仈銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍙戣〃鍦ㄣ�婂仴搴风粡娴庡銆嬫潅蹇椾笂鐨勫叾浠栫爺绌舵敮鎸佹薄鏌撳亣璇淬�傚痉闆峰厠濉炲皵澶у鐨勪綍濉灺峰鐨簹路鏍兼媺绾冲鏂�(Jos茅 Tapia Granados)鍜屽瘑姝囨牴澶у鐨勭埍寰峰崕路鑹惧ゥ灏煎痉鏂�(Edward Ionides)瀵规娲茬粡娴庡ぇ琛伴��鐨勫垎鏋愬彂鐜帮紝澶变笟鐜囧闀�1%涓庡懠鍚哥郴缁熺柧鐥呮浜＄巼闄嶄綆1%鐩稿叧鑱旓紝涔熶笌蹇冭绠＄柧鐥呭拰蹇冭剰鐥呮浜＄巼闄嶄綆鐩稿叧鑱旓紝浜轰滑宸茬粡鐭ラ亾杩欎簺鐤剧梾瀵圭┖姘旀薄鏌撳緢鏁忔劅銆傚湪缁忔祹琛伴��鏇翠负涓ラ噸鐨勫浗瀹垛�斺�旀尝缃楃殑娴峰浗瀹躲�佽タ鐝墮銆佸笇鑵婂拰鏂礇鏂囧凹浜氾紝鍛煎惛绯荤粺鐤剧梾姝讳骸鐜囧湪2007骞磋嚦2010骞撮棿涓嬮檷浜�16%锛岃�屽湪澶ц“閫�鍓嶇殑4骞撮噷锛屽懠鍚哥郴缁熺柧鐥呮浜＄巼浠呬笅闄嶄簡3.2%銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍏朵粬鍥犵礌涔熷缁忔祹鎵╁紶鏈熼棿姝讳骸鐜囩殑涓婂崌璧风潃浣滅敤銆傝亴涓氭�у嵄瀹冲拰鍘嬪姏鍙互閫氳繃宸ヤ綔鐩存帴鍗卞鍋ュ悍銆備竴浜涚爺绌跺彂鐜帮紝閰掔簿鍜岀儫鑽夌殑娑堣垂鍦ㄧ箒鑽ｆ椂鏈熶篃浼氬鍔犮�傝繖涓ょ娑堣垂閮戒笌鏇撮珮鐨勬浜＄巼鏈夊叧銆傛澶栵紝鏈夊伐浣滅殑浜烘洿甯稿紑杞︼紝瀵艰嚧浠栦滑鐨勮溅绁告浜＄巼涓婂崌銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄧ粡娴庤“閫�鏈熼棿锛屾病鏈夊伐浣滅殑浜哄彲鑳芥湁鏇村鐨勬椂闂寸潯瑙夊拰閿荤偧锛屼篃鍙兘鍚冨緱鏇村仴搴枫�備竴椤圭爺绌跺彂鐜帮紝杈冮珮鐨勫け涓氱巼涓庤緝浣庣殑鑲ヨ儢鐜囥�佹洿澶氱殑浣撳姏娲诲姩锛屼互鍙婃洿濂界殑楗瀛樺湪鍏宠仈銆傚彟涓�鏂归潰锛岀粡娴庤“閫�鏈熼棿锛岃嚜鏉�鐜囦笂鍗囥��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏈�杩戠殑涓�浜涚爺绌舵彁鍑猴紝杩戝勾鏉ワ紝缁忔祹鑵鹃鍙兘宸插彉寰椾笉鍐嶉偅涔堣嚧鍛斤紝鑰岀粡娴庤惂鏉″垯鐩稿弽銆傝繖鍙兘鏄幇浠ｇ殑鎵╁紶缁忔祹浣撲娇鐢ㄦ薄鏌撴洿灏戠殑鐢熶骇鏂瑰紡鐨勭粨鏋滐紝涔熷彲鑳芥槸涓哄姹℃煋鐜鏁忔劅浜虹兢鎻愪緵鏇村ソ鐨勫尰鐤楁湇鍔＄殑缁撴灉銆傞亾璺拰姹借溅鍙樺緱鏇村姞瀹夊叏锛屽湪閰掔簿鍜屽叾浠栬嵂鐗╁奖鍝嶄笅椹鹃┒鐨勬儏鍐垫湁鎵�鍑忓皯涔熷彲鑳藉姝ゆ湁浣滅敤銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滀篃鏈夊彲鑳芥槸闃跨墖绫昏嵂鐗╁拰鍏朵粬姣掑搧璁╄“閫�瀵瑰仴搴风殑鍗卞姣斾互鍓嶆洿澶э紝鈥濆崱鐗瑰嫆璇淬��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍏朵粬鍒嗘瀽琛ㄦ槑锛屽敖绠¤緝灏忕殑缁忔祹澧為�熸彁鍗囦簡姝讳骸鐜囷紝浣嗘洿澶х殑缁忔祹绻佽崳鍗村皢鍏堕檷浣庛�傛瘮濡傦紝鏃ユ湰鍦�1960骞翠唬鍜�1970骞翠唬鐨勭粡娴庡闀夸笌鏇撮暱鐨勫鍛界浉鍏宠仈銆傚敖绠¤緝灏忕殑缁忔祹琛伴��鑳藉欢闀垮鍛斤紝浣嗕弗閲嶄笖婕暱鐨勫ぇ琛伴��鈥斺�旀瘮濡傚ぇ钀ф潯鈥斺�斾笌鏇寸煭鐨勫鍛藉瓨鍦ㄧ潃鍏宠仈銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鏇村瘜瑁曠殑鍥藉鍗虫洿鍋ュ悍鐨勫浗瀹讹紝杩欎竴鏁堝簲鍦ㄥ嚑浠ｄ汉涔嬮棿鍙銆備汉鍦ㄦ垚闀挎椂鏈熲�斺�斿効绔ュ拰闈掑皯骞存湡鈥斺�斿缁忔祹鐜鐗瑰埆鏁忔劅銆傚瓙瀹唴鏉′欢浼氬浜虹殑鍋ュ悍鍜岀粡娴庣姸鍐典骇鐢熸寔涔呯殑褰卞搷銆傚湪缁忔祹琛伴��鏃舵湡浠庡ぇ瀛︽瘯涓氳兘鍘嬩綆涓�涓汉鐨勬敹鍏ラ暱杈�10骞淬�傚湪缁忔祹寮哄姴鏃舵湡闀垮ぇ鐨勪汉鏇存湁鍙兘鑾峰緱璧勬簮锛屼篃鏇村彲鑳藉緱鍒颁績杩涘仴搴风殑鎶�鑳藉拰鏈轰細銆傝繖浜涘ソ澶勫彲浠ユ寔缁竴鐢燂紝鑳藉寤堕暱浜虹殑瀵垮懡銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鎬荤殑鏉ヨ锛岄暱鏈熺殑缁忔祹澧為暱鍦ㄦ�讳綋涓婃敼鍠勪簡浜虹被鐨勭姸鍐碉紝杩欏熀鏈鏃犵枒闂�備絾骞堕潪鎵�鏈変汉閮借兘浜彈鍚屾牱鐨勬晥鐩娿�傚湪鐭湡鍐咃紝缁忔祹鎵╁紶鑳借涓�浜涗汉鐨勫鍛界缉鐭��\r\n\r\n\r\nAustin Frakt鏄尝澹】淇濆仴绯荤粺鍚堜綔寰瘉鏀跨瓥璧勬簮涓績鐨勪富绠°�佹尝澹】澶у鍏叡鍗敓瀛﹂櫌鍓暀鎺堜互鍙婂搱浣涘ぇ瀛︽浘鐔欏叕鍏卞崼鐢熷闄㈢殑鍏间换鍓暀鎺堛�備粬鍦ㄢ�淭he Incidental Economist鈥濇挵鍐欏崥瀹紝浣犲彲浠ュ湪Twitter涓婂叧娉ㄤ粬銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛欳indy Hao"
