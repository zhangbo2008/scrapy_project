"As the 1980s ended, Donald Trump’s big bets began to go bust. Trump Shuttle was failing to make loan payments within 15 months. The Plaza, drowning in debt, was bankrupt in four years. His Atlantic City casinos, also drowning in debt, tumbled one by one into bankruptcy.\n到了1980年代末，唐纳德·特朗普下的大赌注开始赔钱。特朗普快线未能在15个月内偿还贷款。广场酒店因负债累累，四年后就破产了。他的大西洋城赌场也陷入了债务危机，一个接着一个地走向破产。\nWhat didn’t fail was the Trump safety net. Just as Donald Trump’s finances were crumbling, family partnerships and companies dramatically increased distributions to him and his siblings. Between 1989 and 1992, tax records show, four entities created by Fred Trump to support his children paid Donald Trump today’s equivalent of $8.3 million.\n但特朗普安全网没有破。就在唐纳德·特朗普的财务情况不断恶化的时候，家族合伙和公司大幅增加了派发给他和兄弟姐妹的钱。税务记录显示，在1989至1992年间，弗雷德·特朗普创建的四个支持子女的实体向唐纳德·特朗普支付了相当于今天830万美元的钱款。\nFred Trump’s generosity also provided a crucial backstop when his son pleaded with bankers in 1990 for an emergency line of credit. With so many of his projects losing money, Donald Trump had few viable assets of his own making to pledge as collateral. What has never been publicly known is that he used his stakes in the mini-empire and the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange as collateral to help secure a $65 million loan.\n弗雷德·特朗普的慷慨，也为儿子在1990年向银行家们申请紧急信贷额度提供了关键的支持。由于唐纳德·特朗普的许多项目都在亏损，他手中几乎没有了任何可供抵押的资产。公众以前从不知道的是，他用自己在迷你帝国和东奥兰治老年公寓的股份作为抵押，帮助他获得了6500万美元的贷款。\nTax records also reveal that at the peak of Mr. Trump’s financial distress, his father extracted extraordinary sums from his empire. In 1990, Fred Trump’s income exploded to $49,638,928 — several times what he paid himself in other years in that era.\n税收记录还显示，在唐纳德的财务困境最糟糕的时候，他的父亲从自己的商业帝国中提取出巨额钱款。1990年，弗雷德·特朗普的收入暴增至49638928美元，是他在那个时代的其他年份给自己开的工资的好几倍。\nFred Trump, former employees say, detested taking unnecessary distributions from his companies because he would have to pay income taxes on them. So why would a penny-pinching, tax-hating 85-year-old in the twilight of his career abruptly pull so much money out of his cherished properties, incurring a tax bill of $12.2 million?\n前雇员们说，弗雷德·特朗普不喜欢从自己的公司获取不必要的派发钱款，因为他不得不为这些钱缴纳所得税。那么，为什么一个吝啬的、对纳税深恶痛绝的85岁老人，会在他职业生涯暮年突然从自己珍爱的房地产中抽出这么多的钱，引来了一张1220万美元的税单呢？\nThe Times found no evidence that Fred Trump made any significant debt payments or charitable donations. The frugality he brought to business carried over to the rest of his life. According to ledgers of his personal spending, he spent a grand total of $8,562 in 1991 and 1992 on travel and entertainment. His extravagances, such as they were, consisted of buying his wife the odd gift from Antonovich Furs or hosting family celebrations at the Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn. His home on Midland Parkway in Jamaica Estates, Queens, built with unfussy brick like so many of his apartment buildings, had little to distinguish it from neighboring houses beyond the white columns and crest framing the front door.\n时报没有找到弗雷德·特朗普有任何大笔债务支付或慈善捐赠的证据。他一生在经营上恪行节俭。据他的个人支出账薄，在旅行和娱乐上，1991年和1992年他总共花了8562美元。他的奢侈消费（如果够得上奢侈的话）包括从安东诺维奇皮草行(Antonovich Furs)给妻子买的零星礼物，或在布鲁克林的彼得鲁格牛排屋(Peter Luger Steak House)举办的家庭庆祝活动。他位于皇后区牙买加庄园(Jamaica Estates)米德兰公园路(Midland Parkway)的家，与他盖的许多公寓楼一样，是用毫不讲究的砖砌成的，除了白色的立柱和大门框上的纹章外，与相邻的房子没有什么区别。\nThere are, however, indications that he wanted plenty of cash on hand to bail out his son if need be.\n然而，有迹象表明，他想在手头上有足够的现金，以备有必要时为儿子提供紧急援助。\nSuch was the case with the rescue mission at his son’s Trump’s Castle casino. Donald Trump had wildly overspent on renovations, leaving the property dangerously low on operating cash. Sure enough, neither Trump’s Castle nor its owner had the necessary funds to make an $18.4 million bond payment due in December 1990.\n救助儿子的特朗普城堡赌场就是一个例子。唐纳德·特朗普在改造赌场上的支出严重超支，使赌场运营现金低到了危险的程度。不论是特朗普城堡，还是城堡的所有者，无疑都无力支付1990年12月到期的1840万美元债券。\nOn Dec. 17, 1990, Fred Trump dispatched Howard Snyder, a trusted bookkeeper, to Atlantic City with a $3.35 million check. Mr. Snyder bought $3.35 million worth of casino chips and left without placing a bet. Apparently, even this infusion wasn’t sufficient, because that same day Fred Trump wrote a second check to Trump’s Castle, for $150,000, bank records show.\n1990年12月17日，弗雷德·特朗普派值得信赖的簿记员霍华德·斯奈德(Howard Snyder)带着一张335万美元的支票前往大西洋城。斯奈德购买了价值335万美元的赌场筹码，没有下注就离开了。看来这笔资金注资还是不够，因为银行记录显示，就在同一天，弗雷德·特朗普又给特朗普城堡开出了一张15万美元的支票。\nWith this ruse — it was an illegal $3.5 million loan under New Jersey gaming laws, resulting in a $65,000 civil penalty — Donald Trump narrowly avoided defaulting on his bonds.\n唐纳德·特朗普利用这个骗术——根据新泽西州的博彩法，这是一笔350万美元的非法贷款，会产生6.5万美元的民事罚款——勉强避免了债券违约。\nBIRDS OF A FEATHER\n物以类聚\n\r\n\n\r\n特朗普和父亲弗雷德·特朗普在20世纪80年代拍摄的广告。\n \nBoth the son and the father were masters of manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.\n儿子和父亲都是操纵资产价值的高手，根据他们的需要让资产看起来或者价值很高，或者不值多少。\nAs the chip episode demonstrated, father and son were of one mind about rules and regulations, viewing them as annoyances to be finessed or, when necessary, ignored. As described by family members and associates in interviews and sworn testimony, theirs was an intimate, endless confederacy sealed by blood, shared secrets and a Hobbesian view of what it took to dominate and win. They talked almost daily and saw each other most weekends. Donald Trump sat at his father’s right hand at family meals and participated in his father’s monthly strategy sessions with his closest advisers. Fred Trump was a silent, watchful presence at many of Donald Trump’s news conferences.\n正如筹码事件所显示的那样，父子二人对规章规则的看法是一致的，他们认为那是需要巧妙处理的东西，或在必要时予以忽略。就像他们的家人和同事在采访和宣誓证词中所描述的那样，他两人的关系是一个亲密无间的永久联盟，是血缘、共享的秘密，以及对主宰和取胜的霍布斯式观点凝结而成的。他们几乎每天都通话，周末也经常见面。唐纳德·特朗普在家庭聚餐时坐在父亲的右手边，他还参加父亲与其最亲密的顾问每月一次的战略会议。在唐纳德·特朗普的许多新闻发布会上，弗雷德·特朗普都是以沉默的、保持警惕的样子出现。\n“I probably knew my father as well or better than anybody,” Donald Trump said in a 2000 deposition.\n“我可能像所有的人那样了解我父亲，甚至比任何人都更了解他，”唐纳德·特朗普在2000年的一份证词中说。\nThey were both fluent in the language of half-truths and lies, interviews and records show. They both delighted in transgressing without getting caught. They were both wizards at manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.\n采访和记录显示，他们都熟练地使用半真半假的语言。他俩人都以违规而不被抓为乐。他们都是操纵资产价值的行家，根据他们的需要让资产看起来或者价值很高，或者不值多少。\nThose talents came in handy when Fred Trump Jr. died, on Sept. 26, 1981, at age 42 from complications of alcoholism, leaving a son and a daughter. The executors of his estate were his father and his brother Donald.\n当42岁的小弗雷德·特朗普因酗酒并发症于1981年9月26日去世，留下一对儿女后，这些才能派上了用场。小弗雷德的遗产执行人是他的父亲和他的弟弟唐纳德。\nFred Trump Jr.’s largest asset was his stake in seven of the eight buildings his father had transferred to his children. The Trumps would claim that those properties were worth $90.4 million when they finished converting them to cooperatives within a few years of his death. At that value, his stake could have generated an estate tax bill of nearly $10 million.\n小弗雷德·特朗普最大的资产是父亲转移给子女的八座大楼中七座的股份。在小弗雷德死后的几年内里，这些房产被改造为合作公寓的形式，特朗普家族报的改造后价值是9040万美元。按这个价值计算，小弗雷德所持的股份可能会产生近1000万美元的遗产税。\nBut the tax return signed by Donald Trump and his father claimed that Fred Trump Jr.’s estate owed just $737,861. This result was achieved by lowballing all seven buildings. Instead of valuing them at $90.4 million, Fred and Donald Trump submitted appraisals putting them at $13.2 million.\n但是，在有唐纳德·特朗普和父亲签名的纳税申报表上，小弗雷德·特朗普的遗产账户仅欠737861美元的税款。这是通过对所有七座建筑进行过低估值来实现的。弗雷德·特朗普和唐纳德·特朗普并没有把这七座建筑估价为9040万美元，他们提交的估价把这些建筑的价值定为1320万美元。\nEmblematic of their audacity was Park Briar, a 150-unit building in Queens. As it happened, 18 days before Fred Trump Jr.’s death, the Trump siblings had submitted Park Briar’s co-op conversion plan, stating under oath that the building was worth $17.1 million. Yet as Fred Trump Jr.’s executors, Donald Trump and his father claimed on the tax return that Park Briar was worth $2.9 million when Fred Trump Jr. died.\n皇后区有150个单位的帕克布瑞尔(Park Briar)公寓是他们胆大冒险的象征。就在小弗雷德·特朗普去世的18天前，特朗普兄弟姐妹们提交了将帕克布瑞尔改造为合作公寓的计划，他们在受宣誓约束之下表示这栋楼价值1710万美元。然而，作为小弗雷德·特朗普的遗嘱执行人，唐纳德·特朗普和父亲在纳税申报单上声称，小弗雷德·特朗普去世时，帕克布瑞尔的价值是290万美元。\nThis fantastical claim — that Park Briar should be taxed as if its value had fallen 83 percent in 18 days — slid past the I.R.S. with barely a protest. An auditor insisted the value should be increased by $100,000, to $3 million.\n这个荒诞的主张——即应该当作帕克布瑞尔的价值在18天里骤减了83%来计算对它的征税——躲过了国税局的眼睛，几乎没有异议。只有一个审计员坚持要把价值提高到300万美元，比原来的高出了10万美元。\nDuring the 1980s, Donald Trump became notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks, hinting of a possible takeover, and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative concessions from the target company to make him go away. It was a form of stock manipulation with an unsavory label: “greenmailing.” The Times unearthed evidence that Mr. Trump enlisted his father as his greenmailing wingman.\n20世纪80年代，唐纳德·特朗普开始有了故意透露风声的臭名。他先是透露自己要购进某个公司的股票，暗示可能要将其收购，然后或是在股价上涨时卖出股票，或是试图让目标公司为了摆脱他而给出有利可图的让步。这是一种股票操纵形式，有一个声名狼藉称号：“绿色勒索”。时报偶然发现的证据表明，唐纳德把父亲招募来为自己的绿色勒索做帮手。\nOn Jan. 26, 1989, Fred Trump bought 8,600 shares of Time Inc. for $934,854, his tax returns show. Seven days later, Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist known to be chatty with Donald Trump, broke the news that the younger Trump had “taken a sizable stake” in Time. Sure enough, Time’s shares jumped, allowing Fred Trump to make a $41,614 profit in two weeks.\n弗雷德·特朗普的报税表显示，1989年1月26日，他花934854美元购买了8600股时代公司(Time Inc.)的股票。七天后，众所周知与唐纳德·特朗普有私下往来的金融专栏作家丹·多尔夫曼(Dan Dorfman)透露，唐纳德·特朗普已“购买了相当份额的时代股票”。果然，时代的股价大幅上涨，弗雷德·特朗普得以在两周内获得了41614美元的利润。\nLater that year, Fred Trump bought $5 million worth of American Airlines stock. Based on the share price — $81.74 — it appears he made the purchase shortly before Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump was taking a stake in the company. Within weeks, the stock was over $100 a share. Had Fred Trump sold then, he would have made a quick $1.3 million. But he didn’t, and the stock sank amid skepticism about his son’s history of hyped takeover attempts that fizzled. Fred Trump sold his shares for a $1.7 million loss in January 1990. A week later, Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump had sold, too.\n同年晚些时候，弗雷德·特朗普购买了价值500万美元的美国航空公司股票。从弗雷德·特朗普买股票时所付的每股81.74美元的价格来看，他似乎是在多尔夫曼报道了唐纳德·特朗普正在购买美航股票的消息不久前买进的。几周内，美航股价就超过了每股100美元。如果当时弗雷德·特朗普就把股票卖掉的话，他本该能赚到130万美元的快钱。但他没有这样做，随着人们开始质疑他儿子热炒收购企图而后不了了之的前科，美航股价下跌了。弗雷德·特朗普于1990年1月卖掉了手中的股票，亏了170万美元。一周后，多尔夫曼报道说，唐纳德·特朗普也把股票卖掉了。\n\r\n\n\r\n唐纳德·特朗普在大西洋城的泰姬陵赌场。到了1980年代末，他的生意中很多已负债累累，开始赔钱。\nWith other family members, Fred Trump could be cantankerous and cruel, according to sworn testimony by his relatives. “This is the stupidest thing I ever heard of,” he’d snap when someone disappointed him. He was different with his son Donald. He might chide him — “Finish this job before you start that job,” he’d counsel — but more often, he looked for ways to forgive and accommodate.\n根据其亲属的宣誓证词，弗雷德·特朗普对待别的家族成员可能会暴躁、粗鲁。“这是我听过最愚蠢的事情，”有人让他失望时他会这样痛骂。对儿子唐纳德就不一样了。他也会责备——“做那件事之前先完成这一件，”他会这样规劝——但更多的时候，他想尽办法宽待和迁就他。\nBy 1987, for example, Donald Trump’s loan debt to his father had grown to at least $11 million. Yet canceling the debt would have required Donald Trump to pay millions in taxes on the amount forgiven. Father and son found another solution, one never before disclosed, that appears to constitute both an unreported multimillion-dollar gift and a potentially illegal tax write-off.\n例如，到1987年的时候，唐纳德·特朗普在父亲那里的贷款债务已增长到至少1100万美元。即使免除债务，唐纳德·特朗普也必须缴纳数百万美元税款。父子俩想了另外的办法，这个方案此前从未披露，看起来包括一笔数百万美元未报税的赠与和一项可能非法的税务冲销。\nIn December 1987, records show, Fred Trump bought a 7.5 percent stake in Trump Palace, a 55-story condominium building his son was erecting on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Most, if not all, of his investment, which totaled $15.5 million, was made by exchanging his son’s unpaid debts for Trump Palace shares, records show.\n记录显示，1987年12月，弗雷德·特朗普购买了特朗普宫(Trump Palace)7.5％的股份，这是他儿子正在曼哈顿上东区建造的一座55层公寓楼。记录显示，这笔总额为1550万美元的投资即便谈不上全部，至少大部分是通过把他儿子的未偿债务转为特朗普宫股份。\nFour years later, in December 1991, Fred Trump sold his entire stake in Trump Palace for just $10,000, his tax returns and financial statements reveal. Those documents do not identify who bought his stake. But other records indicate that he sold it back to his son.\n弗雷德·特朗普的报税表和财务报表显示，四年后，在1991年12月，他仅以1万美元价格出售了自己在特朗普宫的全部股权。这些文件并未明确是谁买下了他的股份。但其他记录显示他是卖回给了儿子。\nUnder state law, developers must file “offering plans” that identify to any potential condo buyer the project’s sponsors — in other words, its owners. The Trump Palace offering plan, submitted in November 1989, identified two owners: Donald Trump and his father. But under the same law, if Fred Trump had sold his stake to a third party, Donald Trump would have been required to identify the new owner in an amended offering plan filed with the state attorney general’s office. He did not do that, records show.\n纽约州法律规定，开发商必须提交“销售计划书”，向未来的共管公寓购买者明确项目发起人的身份，换句话说就是物业的业主。1989年11月提交的特朗普宫销售计划书里注明了两个业主：唐纳德·特朗普和他父亲。然而同一部法律规定，如果弗雷德·特朗普把他的股份售予第三方，唐纳德·特朗普就必须在一份修订后的计划书中注明这位新的业主并提交给州检察长办公室。记录显示，他并未修订及提交计划书。\nHe did, however, sign a sworn affidavit a month after his father sold his stake. In the affidavit, submitted in a lawsuit over a Trump Palace contractor’s unpaid bill, Donald Trump identified himself as “the” owner of Trump Palace.\n父亲售出股份一个月后，唐纳德·特朗普倒是签署了一份宣誓书。这份宣誓书曾呈交给一场关于特朗普宫建设承包商未收到应付款的诉讼，唐纳德·特朗普在宣誓书中确认自己是特朗普宫的“唯一”业主。\nUnder I.R.S. rules, selling shares worth $15.5 million to your son for $10,000 is tantamount to giving him a $15.49 million taxable gift. Fred Trump reported no such gift.\n按国税局规定，把价值1550万美元的股份以1万美元的价格卖给儿子，就等同于给了他一份1549万美元的应税赠与。弗雷德·特朗普不曾为这份赠与报税。\nAccording to tax experts, the only circumstance that would not have required Fred Trump to report a gift was if Trump Palace had been effectively bankrupt when he unloaded his shares.\n税务专家表示，仅在一种情况下弗雷德·特朗普不需要为此申报赠与税，那就是当他脱手股份之时特朗普宫实际上已破产。\nYet Trump Palace was far from bankrupt.\n而特朗普宫远未破产。\n\r\n\n\r\n1981年，在他们的哥哥小弗雷德·特朗普去世前，特朗普的兄弟姐妹们把皇后区的帕克布瑞尔公寓的估值定为1710万美元。然而，作为小弗雷德·特朗普的遗嘱执行人，唐纳德·特朗普和他的父亲在纳税申报单上声称，它仅值290万美元。\nProperty records show that condo sales there were brisk in 1991. Trump Palace sold 57 condos for $52.5 million — 94 percent of the total asking price for those units.\n资产记录显示，1991年时该项目的公寓销售仍然活跃。特朗普宫以5250万美元价格售出了57套公寓，达到这些单位总报价的94％。\nDonald Trump himself proclaimed Trump Palace “the most financially secure condominium on the market today” in advertisements he placed in 1991 to rebut criticism from buyers who complained that his business travails could drag down Trump Palace, too. In December, 17 days before his father sold his shares, he placed an ad vouching for the wisdom of investing in Trump Palace: “Smart money says there has never been a better time.”\n1991年，一些购买者抱怨唐纳德·特朗普的生意困境可能也会拖累特朗普宫的价值，特朗普多次发布广告来反驳这种批评，他自己在广告中宣称特朗普宫是“当下市面上最保险的公寓”。这年12月，在他父亲售出股份前17天，他发布了一则广告打保票说，投资特朗普宫是明智之举：“聪明钱说这是前所未有的好时机。”\nBy failing to tell the I.R.S. about his $15.49 million gift to his son, Fred Trump evaded the 55 percent tax on gifts, saving about $8 million. At the same time, he declared to the I.R.S. that Trump Palace was almost a complete loss — that he had walked away from a $15.5 million investment with just $10,000 to show for it.\n赠与儿子的1549万美元，弗雷德·特朗普没有告知国税局，他由此逃掉55％的赠与税，省下约800万美元。同时，他向国税局报称特朗普宫的投资几乎彻底蚀本——他投入1550万美元最后离场时只剩1万美元就是明证。\nFederal tax law prohibits deducting any loss from the sale of property between members of the same family, because of the potential for abuse. Yet Fred Trump appears to have done exactly that, dodging roughly $5 million more in income taxes.\n由于存在被滥用的可能，联邦税法禁止用任何家庭成员间出售资产的损失来抵扣应税收入。而弗雷德·特朗普似乎恰恰就是这么做的，另外又避过了约500万美元的所得税。\n\r\n\n\r\n1991年，在弗雷德·特朗普宣称他对儿子的特朗普宫的投资几乎彻底蚀本的同时，唐纳德·特朗普对公众说，这是前所未有的购入好时机。\nThe partnership between Fred and Donald Trump was not simply about the pursuit of riches. At its heart lay a more ambitious project, executed to perfection over decades — to create that origin story, the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.\n弗雷德和唐纳德·特朗普的合伙关系不仅仅是为了追求财富。这个关系的核心是一个宏大得多的、在几十年里不断完善的计划——书写唐纳德·J·特朗普的崛起故事，一个白手起家的亿万富翁的神话。\nDonald Trump built the foundation for the myth in the 1970s by appropriating his father’s empire as his own. By the late 1980s, instead of appropriating the empire, he was diminishing it. “It wasn’t a great business, it was a good business,” he said, as if Fred Trump ran a chain of laundromats. Yes, he told interviewers, his father was a wonderful mentor, but given the limits of his business, the most he could manage was a $1 million loan, and even that had to be repaid with interest.\n1970年代唐纳德·特朗普把他父亲的商业帝国算作自己的，为这个神话打下基础。到了1980年代后期，他不再挪用这个帝国，而是开始贬损它。“那不是什么了不起的生意，也就是还不错的生意，”他说得好像弗雷德·特朗普开的是一家连锁自助洗衣房。他告诉采访者，父亲是一位出色的导师，但限于父亲的生意规模，他从父亲那里最多只能拿到100万美元的借款，而且还是要付利息的。\nThrough it all, Fred Trump played along. Never once did he publicly question his son’s claim about the $1 million loan. “Everything he touches seems to turn to gold,” he told The Times for that first profile in 1976. “He’s gone way beyond me, absolutely,” he said when The Times profiled his son again in 1983. But for all Fred Trump had done to build the myth of Donald Trump, Self-Made Billionaire, there was, it turned out, one line he would not allow his son to cross.\n弗雷德·特朗普全程配合。他从未公开质疑儿子对100万美元借款说法。“好像什么东西只要他一碰就都变成了黄金，”在1976年那篇人物特稿中他这样告诉《纽约时报》。“他比我强多了，绝对，”1983年《纽约时报》再次报道他儿子时他说。不过事实证明，尽管在“白手起家的亿万富翁唐纳德·特朗普”这个神话营造过程中不遗余力，弗雷德·特朗普还是设下了一条不许儿子越过的界线。\n翻译：Hongyu Li、Cindy Hao\n\r\n\r\n\nAs the 1980s ended, Donald Trump’s big bets began to go bust. Trump Shuttle was failing to make loan payments within 15 months. The Plaza, drowning in debt, was bankrupt in four years. His Atlantic City casinos, also drowning in debt, tumbled one by one into bankruptcy.\n\r\n\n到了1980年代末，唐纳德·特朗普下的大赌注开始赔钱。特朗普快线未能在15个月内偿还贷款。广场酒店因负债累累，四年后就破产了。他的大西洋城赌场也陷入了债务危机，一个接着一个地走向破产。\n\r\n\nWhat didn’t fail was the Trump safety net. Just as Donald Trump’s finances were crumbling, family partnerships and companies dramatically increased distributions to him and his siblings. Between 1989 and 1992, tax records show, four entities created by Fred Trump to support his children paid Donald Trump today’s equivalent of $8.3 million.\n\r\n\n但特朗普安全网没有破。就在唐纳德·特朗普的财务情况不断恶化的时候，家族合伙和公司大幅增加了派发给他和兄弟姐妹的钱。税务记录显示，在1989至1992年间，弗雷德·特朗普创建的四个支持子女的实体向唐纳德·特朗普支付了相当于今天830万美元的钱款。\n\r\n\nFred Trump’s generosity also provided a crucial backstop when his son pleaded with bankers in 1990 for an emergency line of credit.

In 1990, Fred Trump’s income exploded to $49,638,928 — several times what he paid himself in other years in that era.\n\r\n\n税收记录还显示，在唐纳德的财务困境最糟糕的时候，他的父亲从自己的商业帝国中提取出巨额钱款。1990年，弗雷德·特朗普的收入暴增至49638928美元，是他在那个时代的其他年份给自己开的工资的好几倍。\n\r\n\nFred Trump, former employees say, detested taking unnecessary distributions from his companies because he would have to pay income taxes on them. So why would a penny-pinching, tax-hating 85-year-old in the twilight of his career abruptly pull so much money out of his cherished properties, incurring a tax bill of $12.2 million?\n\r\n\n前雇员们说，弗雷德·特朗普不喜欢从自己的公司获取不必要的派发钱款，因为他不得不为这些钱缴纳所得税。那么，为什么一个吝啬的、对纳税深恶痛绝的85岁老人，会在他职业生涯暮年突然从自己珍爱的房地产中抽出这么多的钱，引来了一张1220万美元的税单呢？\n\r\n\nThe Times found no evidence that Fred Trump made any significant debt payments or charitable donations. The frugality he brought to business carried over to the rest of his life. According to ledgers of his personal spending, he spent a grand total of $8,562 in 1991 and 1992 on travel and entertainment.

Donald Trump had wildly overspent on renovations, leaving the property dangerously low on operating cash. Sure enough, neither Trump’s Castle nor its owner had the necessary funds to make an $18.4 million bond payment due in December 1990.\n\r\n\n救助儿子的特朗普城堡赌场就是一个例子。唐纳德·特朗普在改造赌场上的支出严重超支，使赌场运营现金低到了危险的程度。不论是特朗普城堡，还是城堡的所有者，无疑都无力支付1990年12月到期的1840万美元债券。\n\r\n\nOn Dec. 17, 1990, Fred Trump dispatched Howard Snyder, a trusted bookkeeper, to Atlantic City with a $3.35 million check. Mr. Snyder bought $3.35 million worth of casino chips and left without placing a bet. Apparently, even this infusion wasn’t sufficient, because that same day Fred Trump wrote a second check to Trump’s Castle, for $150,000, bank records show.\n\r\n\n1990年12月17日，弗雷德·特朗普派值得信赖的簿记员霍华德·斯奈德(Howard Snyder)带着一张335万美元的支票前往大西洋城。斯奈德购买了价值335万美元的赌场筹码，没有下注就离开了。看来这笔资金注资还是不够，因为银行记录显示，就在同一天，弗雷德·特朗普又给特朗普城堡开出了一张15万美元的支票。\n\r\n\nWith this ruse — it was an illegal $3.5 million loan under New Jersey gaming laws, resulting in a $65,000 civil penalty — Donald Trump narrowly avoided defaulting on his bonds.\n\r\n\n唐纳德·特朗普利用这个骗术——根据新泽西州的博彩法，这是一笔350万美元的非法贷款，会产生6.5万美元的民事罚款——勉强避免了债券违约。\n\r\n\nBIRDS OF A FEATHER\n\r\n\n物以类聚\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n特朗普和父亲弗雷德·特朗普在20世纪80年代拍摄的广告。\n\r\n\n \nBoth the son and the father were masters of manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.\n\r\n\n儿子和父亲都是操纵资产价值的高手，根据他们的需要让资产看起来或者价值很高，或者不值多少。\n\r\n\nAs the chip episode demonstrated, father and son were of one mind about rules and regulations, viewing them as annoyances to be finessed or, when necessary, ignored. As described by family members and associates in interviews and sworn testimony, theirs was an intimate, endless confederacy sealed by blood, shared secrets and a Hobbesian view of what it took to dominate and win. They talked almost daily and saw each other most weekends. Donald Trump sat at his father’s right hand at family meals and participated in his father’s monthly strategy sessions with his closest advisers. Fred Trump was a silent, watchful presence at many of Donald Trump’s news conferences.\n正如筹码事件所显示的那样，父子二人对规章规则的看法是一致的，他们认为那是需要巧妙处理的东西，或在必要时予以忽略。就像他们的家人和同事在采访和宣誓证词中所描述的那样，他两人的关系是一个亲密无间的永久联盟，是血缘、共享的秘密，以及对主宰和取胜的霍布斯式观点凝结而成的。他们几乎每天都通话，周末也经常见面。唐纳德·特朗普在家庭聚餐时坐在父亲的右手边，他还参加父亲与其最亲密的顾问每月一次的战略会议。在唐纳德·特朗普的许多新闻发布会上，弗雷德·特朗普都是以沉默的、保持警惕的样子出现。\n“I probably knew my father as well or better than anybody,” Donald Trump said in a 2000 deposition.\n“我可能像所有的人那样了解我父亲，甚至比任何人都更了解他，”唐纳德·特朗普在2000年的一份证词中说。\n\r\n\nThey were both fluent in the language of half-truths and lies, interviews and records show. They both delighted in transgressing without getting caught. They were both wizards at manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.\n\r\n\n采访和记录显示，他们都熟练地使用半真半假的语言。他俩人都以违规而不被抓为乐。他们都是操纵资产价值的行家，根据他们的需要让资产看起来或者价值很高，或者不值多少。\n\r\n\nThose talents came in handy when Fred Trump Jr. died, on Sept. 26, 1981, at age 42 from complications of alcoholism, leaving a son and a daughter. The executors of his estate were his father and his brother Donald.\n\r\n\n当42岁的小弗雷德·特朗普因酗酒并发症于1981年9月26日去世，留下一对儿女后，这些才能派上了用场。小弗雷德的遗产执行人是他的父亲和他的弟弟唐纳德。\n\r\n\nFred Trump Jr.’s largest asset was his stake in seven of the eight buildings his father had transferred to his children. The Trumps would claim that those properties were worth $90.4 million when they finished converting them to cooperatives within a few years of his death. At that value, his stake could have generated an estate tax bill of nearly $10 million.\n\r\n\n小弗雷德·特朗普最大的资产是父亲转移给子女的八座大楼中七座的股份。在小弗雷德死后的几年内里，这些房产被改造为合作公寓的形式，特朗普家族报的改造后价值是9040万美元。按这个价值计算，小弗雷德所持的股份可能会产生近1000万美元的遗产税。\n\r\n\nBut the tax return signed by Donald Trump and his father claimed that Fred Trump Jr.’s estate owed just $737,861. This result was achieved by lowballing all seven buildings. Instead of valuing them at $90.4 million, Fred and Donald Trump submitted appraisals putting them at $13.2 million.\n\r\n\n但是，在有唐纳德·特朗普和父亲签名的纳税申报表上，小弗雷德·特朗普的遗产账户仅欠737861美元的税款。这是通过对所有七座建筑进行过低估值来实现的。弗雷德·特朗普和唐纳德·特朗普并没有把这七座建筑估价为9040万美元，他们提交的估价把这些建筑的价值定为1320万美元。\n\r\n\nEmblematic of their audacity was Park Briar, a 150-unit building in Queens. As it happened, 18 days before Fred Trump Jr.’s death, the Trump siblings had submitted Park Briar’s co-op conversion plan, stating under oath that the building was worth $17.1 million. Yet as Fred Trump Jr.’s executors, Donald Trump and his father claimed on the tax return that Park Briar was worth $2.9 million when Fred Trump Jr. died.\n\r\n\n皇后区有150个单位的帕克布瑞尔(Park Briar)公寓是他们胆大冒险的象征。就在小弗雷德·特朗普去世的18天前，特朗普兄弟姐妹们提交了将帕克布瑞尔改造为合作公寓的计划，他们在受宣誓约束之下表示这栋楼价值1710万美元。然而，作为小弗雷德·特朗普的遗嘱执行人，唐纳德·特朗普和父亲在纳税申报单上声称，小弗雷德·特朗普去世时，帕克布瑞尔的价值是290万美元。\n\r\n\nThis fantastical claim — that Park Briar should be taxed as if its value had fallen 83 percent in 18 days — slid past the I.R.S. with barely a protest. An auditor insisted the value should be increased by $100,000, to $3 million.\n\r\n\n这个荒诞的主张——即应该当作帕克布瑞尔的价值在18天里骤减了83%来计算对它的征税——躲过了国税局的眼睛，几乎没有异议。只有一个审计员坚持要把价值提高到300万美元，比原来的高出了10万美元。\n\r\n\nDuring the 1980s, Donald Trump became notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks, hinting of a possible takeover, and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative concessions from the target company to make him go away. It was a form of stock manipulation with an unsavory label: “greenmailing.” The Times unearthed evidence that Mr. Trump enlisted his father as his greenmailing wingman.\n\r\n\n20世纪80年代，唐纳德·特朗普开始有了故意透露风声的臭名。他先是透露自己要购进某个公司的股票，暗示可能要将其收购，然后或是在股价上涨时卖出股票，或是试图让目标公司为了摆脱他而给出有利可图的让步。这是一种股票操纵形式，有一个声名狼藉称号：“绿色勒索”。时报偶然发现的证据表明，唐纳德把父亲招募来为自己的绿色勒索做帮手。\n\r\n\nOn Jan. 26, 1989, Fred Trump bought 8,600 shares of Time Inc. for $934,854, his tax returns show. Seven days later, Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist known to be chatty with Donald Trump, broke the news that the younger Trump had “taken a sizable stake” in Time. Sure enough, Time’s shares jumped, allowing Fred Trump to make a $41,614 profit in two weeks.\n\r\n\n弗雷德·特朗普的报税表显示，1989年1月26日，他花934854美元购买了8600股时代公司(Time Inc.)的股票。七天后，众所周知与唐纳德·特朗普有私下往来的金融专栏作家丹·多尔夫曼(Dan Dorfman)透露，唐纳德·特朗普已“购买了相当份额的时代股票”。果然，时代的股价大幅上涨，弗雷德·特朗普得以在两周内获得了41614美元的利润。\n\r\n\nLater that year, Fred Trump bought $5 million worth of American Airlines stock. Based on the share price — $81.74 — it appears he made the purchase shortly before Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump was taking a stake in the company. Within weeks, the stock was over $100 a share. Had Fred Trump sold then, he would have made a quick $1.3 million. But he didn’t, and the stock sank amid skepticism about his son’s history of hyped takeover attempts that fizzled. Fred Trump sold his shares for a $1.7 million loss in January 1990. A week later, Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump had sold, too.\n\r\n\n同年晚些时候，弗雷德·特朗普购买了价值500万美元的美国航空公司股票。从弗雷德·特朗普买股票时所付的每股81.74美元的价格来看，他似乎是在多尔夫曼报道了唐纳德·特朗普正在购买美航股票的消息不久前买进的。几周内，美航股价就超过了每股100美元。如果当时弗雷德·特朗普就把股票卖掉的话，他本该能赚到130万美元的快钱。但他没有这样做，随着人们开始质疑他儿子热炒收购企图而后不了了之的前科，美航股价下跌了。弗雷德·特朗普于1990年1月卖掉了手中的股票，亏了170万美元。一周后，多尔夫曼报道说，唐纳德·特朗普也把股票卖掉了。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n唐纳德·特朗普在大西洋城的泰姬陵赌场。到了1980年代末，他的生意中很多已负债累累，开始赔钱。\n\r\n\nWith other family members, Fred Trump could be cantankerous and cruel, according to sworn testimony by his relatives. “This is the stupidest thing I ever heard of,” he’d snap when someone disappointed him. He was different with his son Donald. He might chide him — “Finish this job before you start that job,” he’d counsel — but more often, he looked for ways to forgive and accommodate.\n\r\n\n根据其亲属的宣誓证词，弗雷德·特朗普对待别的家族成员可能会暴躁、粗鲁。“这是我听过最愚蠢的事情，”有人让他失望时他会这样痛骂。对儿子唐纳德就不一样了。他也会责备——“做那件事之前先完成这一件，”他会这样规劝——但更多的时候，他想尽办法宽待和迁就他。\n\r\n\nBy 1987, for example, Donald Trump’s loan debt to his father had grown to at least $11 million. Yet canceling the debt would have required Donald Trump to pay millions in taxes on the amount forgiven. Father and son found another solution, one never before disclosed, that appears to constitute both an unreported multimillion-dollar gift and a potentially illegal tax write-off.\n\r\n\n例如，到1987年的时候，唐纳德·特朗普在父亲那里的贷款债务已增长到至少1100万美元。即使免除债务，唐纳德·特朗普也必须缴纳数百万美元税款。父子俩想了另外的办法，这个方案此前从未披露，看起来包括一笔数百万美元未报税的赠与和一项可能非法的税务冲销。\n\r\n\nIn December 1987, records show, Fred Trump bought a 7.5 percent stake in Trump Palace, a 55-story condominium building his son was erecting on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Most, if not all, of his investment, which totaled $15.5 million, was made by exchanging his son’s unpaid debts for Trump Palace shares, records show.\n\r\n\n记录显示，1987年12月，弗雷德·特朗普购买了特朗普宫(Trump Palace)7.5％的股份，这是他儿子正在曼哈顿上东区建造的一座55层公寓楼。记录显示，这笔总额为1550万美元的投资即便谈不上全部，至少大部分是通过把他儿子的未偿债务转为特朗普宫股份。\n\r\n\nFour years later, in December 1991, Fred Trump sold his entire stake in Trump Palace for just $10,000, his tax returns and financial statements reveal. Those documents do not identify who bought his stake. But other records indicate that he sold it back to his son.\n\r\n\n弗雷德·特朗普的报税表和财务报表显示，四年后，在1991年12月，他仅以1万美元价格出售了自己在特朗普宫的全部股权。这些文件并未明确是谁买下了他的股份。但其他记录显示他是卖回给了儿子。\n\r\n\nUnder state law, developers must file “offering plans” that identify to any potential condo buyer the project’s sponsors — in other words, its owners. The Trump Palace offering plan, submitted in November 1989, identified two owners: Donald Trump and his father. But under the same law, if Fred Trump had sold his stake to a third party, Donald Trump would have been required to identify the new owner in an amended offering plan filed with the state attorney general’s office. He did not do that, records show.\n\r\n\n纽约州法律规定，开发商必须提交“销售计划书”，向未来的共管公寓购买者明确项目发起人的身份，换句话说就是物业的业主。1989年11月提交的特朗普宫销售计划书里注明了两个业主：唐纳德·特朗普和他父亲。然而同一部法律规定，如果弗雷德·特朗普把他的股份售予第三方，唐纳德·特朗普就必须在一份修订后的计划书中注明这位新的业主并提交给州检察长办公室。记录显示，他并未修订及提交计划书。\n\r\n\nHe did, however, sign a sworn affidavit a month after his father sold his stake. In the affidavit, submitted in a lawsuit over a Trump Palace contractor’s unpaid bill, Donald Trump identified himself as “the” owner of Trump Palace.\n\r\n\n父亲售出股份一个月后，唐纳德·特朗普倒是签署了一份宣誓书。这份宣誓书曾呈交给一场关于特朗普宫建设承包商未收到应付款的诉讼，唐纳德·特朗普在宣誓书中确认自己是特朗普宫的“唯一”业主。\n\r\n\nUnder I.R.S. rules, selling shares worth $15.5 million to your son for $10,000 is tantamount to giving him a $15.49 million taxable gift. Fred Trump reported no such gift.\n\r\n\n按国税局规定，把价值1550万美元的股份以1万美元的价格卖给儿子，就等同于给了他一份1549万美元的应税赠与。弗雷德·特朗普不曾为这份赠与报税。\n\r\n\nAccording to tax experts, the only circumstance that would not have required Fred Trump to report a gift was if Trump Palace had been effectively bankrupt when he unloaded his shares.\n\r\n\n税务专家表示，仅在一种情况下弗雷德·特朗普不需要为此申报赠与税，那就是当他脱手股份之时特朗普宫实际上已破产。\n\r\n\nYet Trump Palace was far from bankrupt.\n\r\n\n而特朗普宫远未破产。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n1981年，在他们的哥哥小弗雷德·特朗普去世前，特朗普的兄弟姐妹们把皇后区的帕克布瑞尔公寓的估值定为1710万美元。然而，作为小弗雷德·特朗普的遗嘱执行人，唐纳德·特朗普和他的父亲在纳税申报单上声称，它仅值290万美元。\n\r\n\nProperty records show that condo sales there were brisk in 1991. Trump Palace sold 57 condos for $52.5 million — 94 percent of the total asking price for those units.\n\r\n\n资产记录显示，1991年时该项目的公寓销售仍然活跃。特朗普宫以5250万美元价格售出了57套公寓，达到这些单位总报价的94％。\n\r\n\nDonald Trump himself proclaimed Trump Palace “the most financially secure condominium on the market today” in advertisements he placed in 1991 to rebut criticism from buyers who complained that his business travails could drag down Trump Palace, too. In December, 17 days before his father sold his shares, he placed an ad vouching for the wisdom of investing in Trump Palace: “Smart money says there has never been a better time.”\n\r\n\n1991年，一些购买者抱怨唐纳德·特朗普的生意困境可能也会拖累特朗普宫的价值，特朗普多次发布广告来反驳这种批评，他自己在广告中宣称特朗普宫是“当下市面上最保险的公寓”。这年12月，在他父亲售出股份前17天，他发布了一则广告打保票说，投资特朗普宫是明智之举：“聪明钱说这是前所未有的好时机。”\n\r\n\nBy failing to tell the I.R.S. about his $15.49 million gift to his son, Fred Trump evaded the 55 percent tax on gifts, saving about $8 million. At the same time, he declared to the I.R.S. that Trump Palace was almost a complete loss — that he had walked away from a $15.5 million investment with just $10,000 to show for it.\n\r\n\n赠与儿子的1549万美元，弗雷德·特朗普没有告知国税局，他由此逃掉55％的赠与税，省下约800万美元。同时，他向国税局报称特朗普宫的投资几乎彻底蚀本——他投入1550万美元最后离场时只剩1万美元就是明证。\n\r\n\nFederal tax law prohibits deducting any loss from the sale of property between members of the same family, because of the potential for abuse. Yet Fred Trump appears to have done exactly that, dodging roughly $5 million more in income taxes.\n\r\n\n由于存在被滥用的可能，联邦税法禁止用任何家庭成员间出售资产的损失来抵扣应税收入。而弗雷德·特朗普似乎恰恰就是这么做的，另外又避过了约500万美元的所得税。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n1991年，在弗雷德·特朗普宣称他对儿子的特朗普宫的投资几乎彻底蚀本的同时，唐纳德·特朗普对公众说，这是前所未有的购入好时机。\n\r\n\nThe partnership between Fred and Donald Trump was not simply about the pursuit of riches. At its heart lay a more ambitious project, executed to perfection over decades — to create that origin story, the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.\n\r\n\n弗雷德和唐纳德·特朗普的合伙关系不仅仅是为了追求财富。这个关系的核心是一个宏大得多的、在几十年里不断完善的计划——书写唐纳德·J·特朗普的崛起故事，一个白手起家的亿万富翁的神话。\n\r\n\nDonald Trump built the foundation for the myth in the 1970s by appropriating his father’s empire as his own. By the late 1980s, instead of appropriating the empire, he was diminishing it. “It wasn’t a great business, it was a good business,” he said, as if Fred Trump ran a chain of laundromats. Yes, he told interviewers, his father was a wonderful mentor, but given the limits of his business, the most he could manage was a $1 million loan, and even that had to be repaid with interest.\n\r\n\n1970年代唐纳德·特朗普把他父亲的商业帝国算作自己的，为这个神话打下基础。到了1980年代后期，他不再挪用这个帝国，而是开始贬损它。“那不是什么了不起的生意，也就是还不错的生意，”他说得好像弗雷德·特朗普开的是一家连锁自助洗衣房。他告诉采访者，父亲是一位出色的导师，但限于父亲的生意规模，他从父亲那里最多只能拿到100万美元的借款，而且还是要付利息的。\n\r\n\nThrough it all, Fred Trump played along. Never once did he publicly question his son’s claim about the $1 million loan. “Everything he touches seems to turn to gold,” he told The Times for that first profile in 1976. “He’s gone way beyond me, absolutely,” he said when The Times profiled his son again in 1983. But for all Fred Trump had done to build the myth of Donald Trump, Self-Made Billionaire, there was, it turned out, one line he would not allow his son to cross.\n\r\n\n弗雷德·特朗普全程配合。他从未公开质疑儿子对100万美元借款说法。“好像什么东西只要他一碰就都变成了黄金，”在1976年那篇人物特稿中他这样告诉《纽约时报》。“他比我强多了，绝对，”1983年《纽约时报》再次报道他儿子时他说。不过事实证明，尽管在“白手起家的亿万富翁唐纳德·特朗普”这个神话营造过程中不遗余力，弗雷德·特朗普还是设下了一条不许儿子越过的界线。\n\r\n\n翻译：Hongyu Li、Cindy Hao\n\r\n"
