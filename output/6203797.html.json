"In Eagan Friday morning, crop artist Stan Herd was putting the finishing touches on his latest huge work. It's a 1.2-acre rendition of Vincent van Gogh's painting \"Olive Trees.\"\n　　在伊根星期五的早上，“农作物”艺术家斯坦・赫德正为自己的最新力作――1.2英亩的文森特・梵高名作“橄榄树”-“画”上最后的几笔。\n　　\"It never looks like I want it to,\" he said. \"I always know it could be much better. But I'm fairly satisfied with it.\"\n　　“这幅作品从来都不是我想的样子”斯坦・赫德说。“我一直都知道这幅画可以画得更好。但是我对它还是相当满意的。”\n　　The original painting is part of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts collection. For the past six months, Herd has been at work on a parcel of land on the edge of the Thomson Reuters campus, planting, weeding and watering to bring the painting to life. It's part of the institute's centennial celebrations.\n　　原画作属于明尼阿波里斯市艺术学院艺术藏品。过去六个月以来，赫德一直就在汤森路透学院边际的一宗土地上劳作、种树、除草、浇水，赋予画作以生命的活力。这幅画作也是学院一百周年庆典的组成部分。\n　　\"I bit off a lot here, to try to pull this off,\" Herd said. \"A few of the plants were eaten by deer, and a few were blown over. But that's the dance of nature.\"\n　　“我一直在这努力地坚持着，试图把这件事做成功，”赫德说。“栽种的植物一些被麋鹿吃掉了，一些被风给吹走了。但是那只是大自然的舞姿罢了。”\n　　Kansas artist Stan Herd has built a career creating huge images in fields and other open spaces around the world.\n　　堪萨斯州艺术家斯坦赫德已经把在田野上及世界其他开阔的空间中创作巨型画像作为自己的事业了。\n农作物艺术家大地作画：4800平方米梵高名作\n　　A view of the work early in the process, July 28, 2015.\n　　2015年7月28日 创作过程早期阶段画作一览。"
