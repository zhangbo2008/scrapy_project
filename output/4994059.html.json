Davos is a town of peace and serenity, yet the world outside is not tranquil. We need to work together to shape the world in a new global context. I was told that Davos used to be a resort for recuperation from lung diseases, and the later discovery of Penicillin changed that. Now it is a place for people to gather and pool their wisdom for \"brain-storm\". Personally, I find this more than relevant, because our world also needs new forms of \"Penicillin\" to tackle new challenges that have emerged.\n \n毋庸讳言，当今世界远非太平，地区热点、局部冲突以及恐怖袭击等此起彼伏，对人类社会构成现实威胁；全球经济又复苏乏力，主要经济体走势分化，大宗商品价格反复波动，通货紧缩迹象更雪上加霜。不少人对世界前景抱有悲观情绪，认为不仅和平与安宁出了问题，发展也难见曙光。\nAdmittedly, the world today is by no means trouble-free. Regional hotspots, local conflicts and terrorist attacks continue to flare up, posing immediate threats to humanity. Global economic recovery lacks speed and momentum. Major economies are performing unevenly. Commodity prices are going through frequent fluctuations. And signs of deflation have made the situation even worse. In fact, many people are quite pessimistic about the future of the world. They believe that the guarantee of peace is weak, and the prospect of development is elusive.\n \n有哲人说过，当问题出现的时候，不能用曾经制造问题的办法去解决它。老问题的解决，不能再从对抗、仇恨、封闭中谋答案；新问题的应对，更要在对话、协商、合作中找出路。我们要吸取历史经验，运用时代智慧，寻求各方利益的公约数。人类在艰难时刻，总是能激起突破困境的勇气，迸发出变革创新的力量。\nA philosopher once observed that we cannot solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them. Indeed, old problems can no longer be solved by clinging to the outdated mindset of confrontation, hatred and isolation. Dialogue, consultation and cooperation must be explored to find solutions to new problems. It is important that we draw lessons from history, and pool our collective wisdom to maximize the convergence of interests among countries. Fortunately, in time of hardship and trial, mankind have always been able to find the courage to get out of the predicament and move ahead through change and innovation.\n \n面对复杂的国际局势，我们主张要坚定维护和平稳定。今年是世界反法西斯战争胜利70周年。保持世界和平稳定，符合各国人民共同利益。二战后形成的国际秩序和普遍公认的国际关系准则，必须维护而不能打破，否则繁荣和发展也就无从谈起。国家间应摈弃冷战思维与零和游戏，“赢者通吃”是行不通的。任何地区热点和地缘冲突，都应坚持通过政治手段、以和平方式寻求解决。我们反对一切形式的恐怖主义。中国将继续走和平发展道路，维护地区稳定，无意与任何国家一争高下。世界各国都要像爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护和平，让文明理性正义之花开遍世界。\n In a world facing complex international situation, we should all work together to uphold peace and stability. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the victory of the world's anti-Fascist war. To uphold peace and stability serves the interests of all people in the world. The world order established after World War II as well as generally recognized norms governing international relations must be maintained, not overturned. Otherwise, prosperity and development could be jeopardized. The Cold War and zero-sum mentalities must be abandoned. The \"winner takes all\" approach will not work. Regional hotspots and geopolitical conflicts must be resolved peacefully through political means. Terrorism, in all its manifestations, must be opposed. China remains committed to peaceful development and regional stability. And China has no intention to compete with other countries for supremacy. Peace in the world must be cherished the same as we cherish our eyes, so that the achievements and benefits of civilization, including reason and justice, will prevail.\n \n面对多元的世界文明，我们主张要共同促进和谐相处。文化多样性与生物多样性一样，是我们这个星球最值得珍视的天然宝藏。人类社会是各种文明都能盛开的百花园，不同文化之间、不同宗教之间，都应相互尊重、和睦共处。同可相亲，异宜相敬。国际社会应以海纳百川的胸怀，求同存异、包容互鉴、合作共赢。\nIn a world of diverse civilizations, we should all seek to live in harmony. Cultural diversity, like biodiversity, is a most precious treasure endowed to us on this planet. And human society is like a garden where all human civilizations blossom. Different cultures and religions need to respect and live in harmony with each other. While maintaining the natural close ties among those with whom we see eye to eye, we also need to respect those with whom we disagree. Like the vast ocean admitting all rivers that run into it, members of the international community need to work together to expand common ground while accepting differences, and seek win-win progress through inclusive cooperation and mutual learning.\n \n面对多变的经济形势，我们主张要大力推动开放创新。国际金融危机爆发7年来的实践证明，唯有同舟共济，才能渡过难关。在相互依存的世界里，各国有权根据自己的国情制定经济政策，但是也应加强同其他国家的宏观政策协调，扩大利益汇合点，实现共同发展。欧洲有谚语讲：“面对变革之风，有人砌围墙，有人转风车。”我们倡导顺势而为，坚定不移推进自由贸易，旗帜鲜明反对保护主义，积极扩大区域经济合作，打造全球价值链，迎接新科技革命的到来。宏观政策固然重要，但结构性改革势在必行，这是国际社会的共识。尽管难度很大，但也应该坚持去做，这样才能形成全球创新合力，增强世界发展的新动能。\nIn a world facing volatile economic situation, we should all work to promote opening-up and innovation. What has happened since the outbreak of the international financial crisis seven years ago proves that to work in unity is the surest way for countries to get over the difficulties. We are all interdependent in this world. While we each have the right to adopt economic policies in line with national conditions, we need to strengthen macro-policy coordination to expand the convergence of interests and achieve common development. An European proverb says, \"when the wind of change blows, some build walls, while others build windmills.\" We need to act along the trend of our time, firmly advance free trade, resolutely reject protectionism, and actively expand regional economic cooperation. We need to build global value chains, and seize the opportunity of a new technological revolution. While the international community agree on the importance of macro-policies to the economy, they also recognize the urgency to go ahead with structural reform. Structural reform must be carried through no matter how difficult it is, as it is an effective way to foster conditions conducive to global innovation and bring about new momentum for global development.\n女士们，先生们！\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n \n我知道，与会者对中国经济前景很关注，或许有人担忧受到中国经济速度放缓的拖累，还有人担忧受到中国经济转型的冲击。因此，我想多介绍中国的情况。\nI know you are all interested in the outlook of the Chinese economy. Some of you may even worry about the possible potential impact of China's economic slowdown and transition. To ease your concerns, let me spend more time today on what is really happening in China.\n \n当前，中国经济发展进入新常态，经济由高速增长转为中高速增长，发展必须由中低端水平迈向中高端水平，为此要坚定不移推动结构性改革。\nThe Chinese economy has entered a state of new normal. The gear of growth is shifting from high speed to medium-to-high speed, and development needs to move from low-to-medium level to medium-to-high level. This has made it all the more necessary for us to press ahead with structural reform.\n \n应当看到，中国经济增速有所放缓，既有世界经济深度调整的大背景，也是内在的经济规律。现在，中国经济规模已居世界第二，基数增大，即使是7%的增长，年度现价增量也达到8000多亿美元，比5年前增长10%的数量还要大。经济运行处在合理区间，不一味追求速度了，紧绷的供求关系变得舒缓，重荷的资源环境得以减负，可以腾出手来推进结构性改革，向形态更高级、分工更复杂、结构更合理的发展阶段演进。这样，中国经济的“列车”不仅不会掉挡失速，反而会跑得更稳健有力，带来新机遇，形成新动能。\nIt must be noted that the moderation of growth speed in China reflects both profound adjustments in the world economy as well as the law of economics. The Chinese economy is now the second largest in the world. With a larger base figure, a growth even at 7% will produce an annual increase of more than 800 billion US dollars at current price, larger than a 10% growth five years ago. With the economy performing within the reasonable range and the speed of growth no longer taken as the sole yardstick, the strained supply-demand relationship will be eased, the pressure on resources and the environment will be lowered, and more time and energy will be devoted to push forward structural reform. That means, the economy will enter a more advanced stage of development, with more sophisticated division of labor and a more optimized structure. If I could compare the Chinese economy to a running train. What I want you to know is that this train will not lose speed or momentum. It will only be powered by stronger dynamo and run with greater steadiness, bringing along new opportunities and new momentum of growth.\n \n刚刚过去的2014年，我们就是按照这个思路做的。面对下行压力，我们没有采取强刺激，而是强力推进改革，尤其是政府带头改革，大力简政放权，激发市场和企业的活力。全年GDP增长7.4%，在世界主要经济体中是的；城镇新增就业1300多万人，在经济放缓情况下不减反增，登记失业率、调查失业率都是下降的；CPI上涨2%，低于年初预期目标。事实说明，我们出台的一系列宏观调控政策是正确的、有效的。更重要的是结构性改革迈出新步伐。\nIn 2014, we followed exactly the afore-mentioned approach. In the face of downward pressure, we did not resort to strong stimulus; instead, we vigorously pursued reforms, and the government in fact led these reforms by streamlining administration and delegating power. This has motivated both the market and the business sector. GDP grew by 7.4% for the whole year, the best among major economies in the world. Over 13 million new jobs were created in cities, with both registered and surveyed unemployment rates lower than the previous year. That is, we achieved growth in employment despite the economic slowdown. CPI was kept at 2%, lower than the target set at the beginning of the year. These outcomes prove that the host of macro-regulation measures China adopted have been right and effective. More importantly, new progress has been made in advancing structural reform.\n \n不可否认，2015年，中国经济仍面临较大下行压力。在这种情况下如何选择？是追求短期更高增长，还是着眼长期中高速增长，提升发展质量？答案是后者。我们将继续保持战略定力，实施积极的财政政策和稳健的货币政策，不会搞“大水漫灌”，而是更加注重预调微调，更好实行定向调控，确保经济运行在合理区间，同时着力提升经济发展的质量和效益。\nNeedless to say, the Chinese economy will continue to face substantial downward pressure in 2015. What shall we choose to do under such circumstances? Shall we go for even higher growth for the short term, or for medium-to-high growth and a higher quality of development over the long run? The answer is definitely the latter. We will maintain our strategic focus and continue to pursue a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy. We will avoid adopting indiscriminate policies. Instead, we will put more emphasis on anticipatory adjustment and fine-tuning, do an even better job with targeted macro-regulation to keep the economy operating within the reasonable range, and raise the quality and performance of the economy.\n \n我们正在采取有效措施防范债务、金融等潜在风险。中国储蓄率高达50%，能够为经济增长提供充裕资金。地方性债务70%以上用于基础设施建设，是有资产保障的。金融体制改革也正在推进。我在这里要向大家传递的信息是，中国不会发生区域性、系统性金融风险，中国经济不会出现“硬着陆”。\nWe are taking effective measures to fend off debt, financial and other potential risks. China's high savings rate, which now stands at 50%, generates sufficient funds for sustaining economic growth. Besides, China's local debt, over 70% of which was incurred for infrastructure development, is backed by assets. And reform of the financial system is making progress. What I want to emphasize is that regional or systemic financial crisis will not happen in China, and the Chinese economy will not head for a hard landing.\n \n要看到，中国还是一个发展中国家，实现现代化还有很长的路要走。和平是中国发展的基础条件，改革开放和人民对幸福美好生活的追求是发展的动力。中国城乡和区域发展空间广阔，国内需求潜力巨大。以中高速再发展一、二十年，中国的面貌就会持续改善，也会给世界带来更多发展机遇。\nIt must be pointed out that China is still a developing country and still has a long way to go before achieving modernization. While peace is the basic condition for China's development, reform and opening-up along with our people's desire for a happy life constitute the strongest impetus propelling development. The space of development in China's rural and urban areas and various regions is enormous, and the country's domestic demand will simply generate great potential of growth. Development at medium-to-high speed for another ten to twenty years will bring even bigger changes to China and create more development opportunities for the world.\n \n中国经济要顶住下行压力，实现“双中高”，就需要对传统思维“说不”，为创新体制“叫好”，下决心推进结构性改革。要创新宏观调控，增添微观活力，调整城乡、区域和产业结构，促进比较充分的就业特别是年轻人的就业，改善收入分配和民生福祉。这需要付出艰辛努力，但是我们将不畏困难。只有沿着促改革、调结构的路子坚定走下去，才能使中国经济长期保持中高速增长，发展迈向中高端水平。\nFor the Chinese economy to withstand downward pressure, and to maintain medium-to-high speed of growth and achieve medium-to-high level of development, we need to say \"no\" to traditional mindset. We must encourage innovative institutions, and press ahead with structural reform. We need to adopt more innovative macro-regulation policies and develop a more vigorous micro economy. We need to promote more balanced development of industries, between rural and urban areas and among regions. We need to ensure relatively high employment rate, especially sufficient employment for the young people. And we need to optimize income distribution and raise the people's welfare. All this certainly calls for tremendous efforts. Yet we will stay undaunted in the face of difficulties. We will unswervingly press ahead with reform and restructuring to ensure that our economy maintains medium-to-high speed of growth and achieves medium-to-high level of development.\n \n中国经济要行稳致远，必须全面深化改革。用好政府和市场这“两只手”，形成“双引擎”。一方面要使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用，培育打造新引擎；另一方面要更好发挥政府作用，改造升级传统引擎。\nTo ensure long-term and steady growth of the Chinese economy, we need to comprehensively deepen reforms. We need to properly use both the hand of the government and the hand of the market, and rely on both the traditional and new engines of growth. We will let the market play a decisive role in resource allocation to foster a new engine of growth. At the same time, we will give better scope to the role of the government to transform and upgrade the traditional engine of growth.\n \n我们说要打造新引擎，就是推动大众创业、万众创新。中国有13亿人口、9亿劳动力、7000万企业和个体工商户，人民勤劳而智慧。如果把全社会每一个细胞都激活，就会使整个经济肌体充满生机，进而汇聚成巨大的推动力量。大众创业、万众创新蕴藏着无穷创意和无限财富，是取之不竭的“金矿”。\nTo foster a new engine of growth, we will encourage mass entrepreneurship and innovation. China has 1.3 billion people, a 900-million workforce, and over 70 million enterprises and self-employed businesses. Our people are hard-working and talented. If we could activate every cell in society, the economy of China as a whole will brim with more vigor and gather stronger power for growth. Mass entrepreneurship and innovation, in our eyes, is a \"gold mine\" that provides constant source of creativity and wealth.\n \n这使我想起30多年前的中国农村改革，放开搞活，让农民自主决定生产经营，调动了广大农民的积极性，结果只用了短短几年时间，就解决了长期没有解决的吃饭问题。制度创新激发了亿万人的创造力，也改变了亿万人的命运。两个月前，我去了中国东部的一个村庄，那里有700多户人家，却开设了2800多家注册网店，每天向世界各地售出超过3000万件各类商品。这就是勤劳肯干大众创业的生动写照。\n Speaking of this, I think of China's rural reform conducted more than 30 years ago. The reform brought farmers' initiatives into full play and allowed them to decide for themselves matters related to rural production and management. Consequently, the problem of hunger that previously haunted China was solved in just a couple of years. In short, a structural innovation that unleashed the creativity of the people changed the lot of hundreds of millions in China. I also think of a small village I visited two months ago in eastern China. In the village were some 700 households and over 2,800 registered online stores. Each day, more than 30 million items of various sorts were sold to different parts of the world. The story of the village speaks vividly of the hard-working Chinese people actively engaged in entrepreneurship."
