"China has increased import duties up to 25 percent on a list of U.S. goods, including pork, fruit and other products, amounting to $3 billion.\r\nThe tariffs, which took effect immediately on April 2, were announced late Sunday by China's finance ministry, who said the country was responding to a U.S. tariff hike on steel and aluminum that took effect on March 23.\r\nChina's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Monday it was suspending its obligations to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce tariffs on 120 U.S. goods, including fruit and ethanol. The import duties on those products will be raised by an extra 15 percent.\r\nThe retaliatory tariffs come as the trade tensions between Beijing and Washington escalate.\r\nEconomic observers said the immediate impact should be limited, but investors have feared a full-blown trade spat between the two countries may depress global commerce and subsequently be damaging for world growth.\r\nIn the meantime, U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing to also impose tariffs on more than $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. The move is intended to punish Beijing over U.S. accusations that China has systematically misappropriated American intellectual property. Beijing has repeatedly denied such allegations.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�4鏃� 浣滆��:缇庡浗涔嬮煶(VOA News)\r\n涓浗瀵瑰寘鎷尓鑲夈�佹按鏋滃拰鍏跺畠涓�浜涗骇鍝佸湪鍐呯殑缇庡浗浜у搧鍔犳敹25%鐨勮繘鍙ｇ◣锛屾�昏30浜跨編鍏冦��\r\n涓浗璐㈡斂閮ㄦ槦鏈熷ぉ瀹ｅ竷锛屾柊鍏崇◣浠�4鏈�2鍙锋槦鏈熶竴绔嬪嵆鐢熸晥銆備腑鍥借储鏀块儴璇达紝涓浗鏄拡瀵圭編鍥藉閽㈤搧鍜岄摑浜у搧鍔犲緛鍏崇◣鍋氬嚭鐨勫弽搴斻�傜編鍥界殑鍔犵◣浠�3鏈�23鍙风敓鏁堜腑鍥藉綋澶╁氨鍏竷浜嗗皢澧炴敹鍏崇◣鐨勪竴绯诲垪缇庡浗浜у搧銆�\r\n涓浗鍟嗗姟閮ㄦ槦鏈熶竴涓婂崍鍙戣〃澹版槑璇达紝灏嗗鍖呮嫭姘存灉鍜屼箼閱囧湪鍐呯殑120椤圭編鍥戒骇鍝佺粓姝㈡牴鎹笘璐哥粍缁囩殑鎵胯鑰岀粰浜堢殑鍏崇◣鍑忚銆備腑鍥藉杩欎簺缇庡浗浜у搧鐨勫緛绋庝粠鑰屽皢澧炲姞15%銆�\r\n涓浗閲囧彇鎶ュ鎬у绋庢帾鏂戒箣闄咃紝缇庡浗鍜屼腑鍥界殑璐告槗鍏崇郴瓒嬪悜绱у紶銆�\r\n\r\n鍖椾含涓�瀹惰秴甯傚嚭鍞編鍥借繘鍙ｅ潥鏋� 锛�2018骞�3鏈�23鏃ワ級\r\n\r\n缁忔祹瑙傚療浜哄＋璇达紝绔嬪嵆浜х敓鐨勫奖鍝嶆湁闄愶紝浣嗘槸鎶曡祫鑰呮媴蹇冭繖涓や釜鍥藉涔嬮棿鐨勫叏闈㈣锤鏄撴垬浼氬奖鍝嶅叏鐞冪殑鍟嗕笟娲诲姩锛屼粠鑰屽奖鍝嶄笘鐣岀粡娴庡闀裤��\r\n涓庢鍚屾椂锛岀編鍥芥�荤粺宸濇櫘鍑嗗瀵逛竴浜涗腑鍥戒骇鍝佸姞寰佹�诲叡500浜跨編鍏冪殑鍏崇◣銆傜編鍥芥寚绉颁腑鍥界郴缁熸�у湴涓嶆褰撹幏鍙栫編鍥界殑鐭ヨ瘑浜ф潈銆備腑鍥戒竴鐩村惁璁ょ編鍥界殑鎸囩О銆�"
