But the particulars of his subleasing arrangements are as difficult to pin down as he is.\n餐厅楼上，在这幢由法拉盛头面人物拥有和管理的公寓楼里，宋扬为她的房间支付一笔固定的房费——同行说高达400美元一晚。钱交给了一个四方头型、神出鬼没的“老板”，她们叫他“老李”，这种称呼表明他与给他干活的这些女人很熟。但是，他转租这些房间的具体安排，就像他的行踪一样难以确定。\nOne spring midnight, Lao Li made a rare appearance on 40th Road to mediate a dispute over clients that had erupted among the women. When a reporter approached and called him by name, Lao Li looked up — and bolted. He dashed east down the center of 40th Road, dodging cars, before vanishing into the dark Flushing night.\n今年春天的一个午夜，老李罕见地出现在40路，他是来调停女人们因为抢客爆发的一场纠纷的。当一名记者走过去叫了他的名字后，老李抬头看了看，拔腿就跑。他在40路的路中间朝东飞奔，躲避着过往的车辆，然后消失在法拉盛的夜幕中。\n\r\nAlthough Song Yang and other women often quarreled, they occasionally gathered with Lao Li at the restaurant downstairs, or at a nearby karaoke bar. They’d watch him blow out a candle on his birthday cake, or sing along to a song popular in his native northeast China. At the Chinese New Year, he would hand out red envelopes containing small cash gifts.\n虽然宋扬和其他女人常常吵架，她们偶尔也在楼下餐厅或附近的一家卡拉OK与老李聚会。她们看他吹灭生日蛋糕上的蜡烛，或和他一起唱他东北老家流行的一首歌。在中国阴历新年，他会给她们发装了小额钞票的红包。\nIn cellphone videos and photographs of these get-togethers, the participants could easily be mistaken for co-workers at an accounting firm, making a night of it. They seemed untroubled by their profession’s many perils, including robbery, bodily harm — and, especially, arrest.\n在手机拍摄的这些聚会的视频和照片里，她们很容易被人误以为是某家会计师事务所的同事，痛快地玩上一夜。她们看上去一点也不为她们从事的职业中的诸多危险，包括被抢、肉体伤害，尤其是被抓所烦恼。\nArrest attracted unwelcome attention. It jeopardized applications for permanent residency. It magnified the humiliation. And it usually meant an appearance at the Human Trafficking Intervention Court, held on Fridays in the basement of the Queens Criminal Court in Kew Gardens, where Mandarin sometimes seems as common as English.\n被抓引来不必要的注意，会危及当事人的永久居留申请。被抓也加重了羞辱感，通常意味着要在皇后区人口走私法院(Human Trafficking Intervention Court)出庭，这个法庭每周五在位于秋园的皇后区刑事法院的地下室开庭。在法拉盛的秋园，普通话似乎同英语一样普遍。\nEstablished nearly 15 years ago, the court set out to treat women in the commercial sex trade less as accused criminals than as victims of trafficking and exploitation. They are told that charges will be dismissed and records sealed if they complete several individualized counseling sessions — focused, say, on job training, or education — with Garden of Hope, Restore NYC, Womankind or another outreach organization. A group called Sanctuary for Families is also on hand to provide immigration services.\n人口贩卖干预法庭是差不多15年前成立的，法庭想达到的目的是，把性交易当中的女子当作贩卖与剥削的受害者来对待，而不是被指控的罪犯。这些女子被告知，只要完成若干个性化的咨询辅导班——比如以就业培训或职业教育为主的——就可以撤销对她们指控，并封存记录。这些辅导班由纽约励馨妇幼关怀中心(Garden of Hope)、纽约市恢复中心(Restore NYC)、纽约亚裔妇女中心(Womankind)等服务机构提供。一家名为“家庭庇护所”(Sanctuary for Families)的组织也可提供移民服务。\n\r\n\n\r\n宋扬的遗物。\n\r\nSong Yang went through this process more than once. In addition to expunging the arrests from her record, these court appearances provided pause, forcing her to confront the consequences of her work life.\n宋扬不止一次走过这个过程。上法庭不仅让她记录中的这些逮捕被抹去，还给了她喘息的时间，迫使她面对她职业生活的后果。\nIn the summer of 2016, Song Yang began frequent WeChat dialogues with a Flushing lawyer, Chen Mingli, that at first focused on acquiring permanent residency — a process that he repeatedly told her could take months and months. Still, she fretted that her arrest history would thwart her application for a green card.\n2016年夏天，宋扬与法拉盛律师陈明利开始进行频繁的微信对话，最初主要是关于获得永久居留权的——他反复告诉她，这个过程可能要好几个月的时间。不过，她还是担心被捕的历史会妨碍她的绿卡申请。\n\r\n\nI am having a lot of anxiety\n, she wrote in Chinese.\n“我心里压力很大很急，”她用中文写道。\nGradually, though, their conversations came to reflect the darker realities of her 40th Road realm, with sobbing emoticons peppering her messages.\n渐渐地，他们的对话开始反映出她身处40路境地的更为阴暗的现实，她的微信里加了许多哭泣表情符。（以下引言均为微信原文——编注）\n \nGood morning, Lawyer Chen,\n she wrote in mid-October 2016. \nA police officer put a gun to my head today and forced me to perform oral sex.\n“陈律师早上好，”她在2016年10月中旬写道。“我今天被警察用枪指着我的头强迫我为他口交。”\nAt the insistence of a friend, she had filed a complaint with the 109th Precinct. Investigators spent the day in her “shop,” looking for evidence and checking the building’s surveillance video, which had captured a heavyset bald man in a suit ascending the stairs\n.\n在一个朋友的坚持下，她向纽约市警局109分局投诉。调查员在她“店”里花了一整天的时间寻找证据，并查看了公寓楼的监控录像，录像拍到一名身穿西装的敦实、秃顶男子走上楼梯。\nMr. Chen assured her that the matter would not affect the status of her immigration case, and implored her to cooperate with the police. But her intense desire to avoid attention, coupled with fear of retaliation from her attacker, overshadowed everything.\n\r\n陈律师向她保证，被捕的事不会影响她移民案件的状况，并恳请她与警方合作。但她不想吸引注意力的强烈渴望，加上害怕受到加害人的报复，给所有的事情蒙上了阴影。\n \nThe police said that this won’t affect me in any way, but I’m afraid that it will … Lawyer Chen, what am I going to do now? … \n(Sob)\n \n(Sob)\n \n(Sob)\n“警察说过不会对我有任何影响，但我还是害怕会受到影响……陈律师我该怎么办现在？\n（流泪）（流泪）（流泪）\n”\n\r\nThe police circulated a wanted poster based on a hazy photograph of the man lifted from the surveillance video. A retired United States Marshal, who surrendered after someone mentioned him as a possible suspect, participated in a lineup.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\n警方用监控录像中截取的一张模糊的男子照片发了一份通缉海报。一名美国退休法警在有人提到他可能有嫌疑后自首，他被安排参加了一次指认。\nBut Song Yang identified another man, wrongly, as her attacker. In addition, a DNA sample from the retired marshal did not match samples taken from Song Yang’s clothing. The case was eventually closed.\n\r\n可是宋扬错误地指认为了另一名男子。此外，退休法警的DNA样本也与宋扬衣物上提取的样本不符。这个案件最终不了了之。\n\r\nSeveral months later, in late September 2017, she was arrested a third time on a prostitution charge. Handcuffed, led away from 40th Road, held overnight.\n几个月后，也就是2017年9月末，她因卖淫指控第三次被逮捕，戴着手铐被从40路带走关了一宿。\nA few days later, Mr. Chen asked, \nYou’ve been arrested again?\n过了几天，陈律师问，“你又被捕了？”\nSong Yang answered:\n宋扬回答：\n \nYeah.\n (Sob)\n \n(Sob)\n \n(Sob)\n“恩。\n（流泪）（流泪）（流泪）\n”\nShe explained that she had been forced to make hard decisions and that it had been difficult to suppress her feelings while married to a much older man who seemed increasingly removed from her day-to-day life. She felt “morally depraved,” and sometimes thought about giving it all up and going home — or worse.\n她解释说，她已被迫要做出艰难的选择，还说嫁给一个比自己大得多的男人，而他离她的日常生活越来越远，让她很难控制自己的情绪。她觉得自己“自甘堕落”，有时候想过放弃这种生活回家算了，也有过更坏的念头。\n \nI’ve been having thoughts of jumping from a building, but what should I do? \nshe wrote early one morning.\n“想跳楼的心情都有了，可是我该怎么办呢？”一天大清早她写道。\nMr. Chen was never formally hired by Song Yang, but now his central role seemed to be to buoy her spirits.\n陈律师从未受到宋扬的正式聘请，可这时候他的核心任务似乎是提升她的情绪。\n \nDon’t be scared\n, he wrote hours later. \nDon’t think that way\n.\n“不要怕，”几小时后他写道。“不要这么想。”\nSong Yang only sank deeper.\n宋扬却更低落了。\n \nI’ve fallen so low I can’t be saved.\n“我觉得我堕落的无法救要了。”\nShe continued:\n她又接着说：\n \nWithout purpose, without direction, what meaning is there to keep on living?\n“没有了目标没有了方向人活的还有什么意义？”\n \nI used to be a woman who was very strong in her life. I strove for perfection in everything I did. I never thought that my life would turn out this way. I’ve truly failed.\n“\n我曾经是一个对生活很上进很要强的女人，做什么事情都追求完美，我没有想到我的人生让我变成这个样子，我好失败。”\nAt the end of October, Song Yang made one last visit to Mr. Chen’s office. She confided that another client had badly beaten her a couple of weeks earlier — an assault she had not reported to the police — and showed him photographs of her bruised and swollen face.\n2017年10月底，宋扬最后一次来到陈律师的办公室。她倾吐说，几周前又有个客人打她打得很重——这次侵害她没报警，她让律师看了自己脸上青肿的照片。\r\n\n\r\n40路上几乎全是中国人，街上的饭店招牌通常一句英文也没有。\n \r\n“Why am I so unlucky?” he remembers her asking.\n“我怎么这么不走运呀？”他记得她问道。\n \nThe case began with an anonymous complaint\n: Several women were said to be “selling intimacy” at the building at 135-32 40th Road.\n这次的案子始于一个匿名投诉：据投诉，有数名女子在40路135-32号楼内“卖性交”。\nThe tip hardly came as a revelation, since shady activities at this address had generated scores of 911 calls over the years. To some, the building even had the aura of being cursed, following a horrific crime in 2010, in which a deranged stalker stabbed a woman in the second-floor hallway and removed her heart and lungs.\n这个投诉根本算不上什么曝光，多年来这个地址发生的不三不四的勾当已产生过大量的911电话报警。在有些人眼里，这幢楼甚至有一种被诅咒的气氛，因为2010年那里发生过一件骇人的罪案。一个精神错乱的尾随者在二楼走廊里捅死了一名女子，还把她的心和肺挖了出来。\nForty-three arrests had taken place in the building over the last decade, more than a few sex-related, the most recent that of Song Yang. Ensnared in an undercover sting in late September, she had tried but failed to hide in the cramped boiler room across from her apartment, and was charged with offering sex for $70.\n在过去十年间，这幢楼里发生过43起逮捕，其中不少是涉性案件，最近的一次就是宋扬。去年9月底她落进了一次卧底行动的陷阱，她想躲进房间对面狭小的锅炉房但未能逃身，对她的指控是以70美元的价格提供性服务。\nHer case, which had prompted those despairing messages to the lawyer Mr. Chen, was one of 91 massage-parlor-related arrests in the 109th Precinct in 2017, and one of six along 40th Road. According to court records, none of those arrests were for pimping, solicitation or operating an unlicensed massage parlor.\n\r\n2017年，109分局共有91起与按摩店有关的逮捕，其中40路上的有6起，她的案子是其中之一。那次逮捕导致了那些发给陈律师的绝望短信。\n\r\nA few nights after the anonymous complaint, a sergeant and a detective ended a brief surveillance by venturing into the notorious building. The only thing they found suspicious was a handwritten sign in Chinese on the second floor, which they believed to say, in effect, \nThere are no girls on this floor; please go to the third floor.\n收到匿名投诉的几个晚上之后，一名警长和一名探员在对这幢臭名昭著的公寓楼进行了简短监视后，进到楼里。他们找到的唯一可疑物品是二楼的一个手写的中文标记，他们原以为上面写的东西大意是“本层没有小姐，请上三楼。”\nThe police later determined that the sign actually said, “Attention, the driving school is on the third floor next door.”\n警方后来确认了标记上写的是“注意……驾校在隔壁三楼。”\nAn undercover officer then telephoned a woman associated with the building who was known as SiSi. They arranged an appointment for the next evening, Saturday, Nov. 25. Her price: $120.\n一名卧底警员随后给一个与这栋公寓楼有关系的、名叫西西的女人打了电话。两人把约会定在次日，11月25日，周六。她的价格：120美元。\nOn the appointed day, members of the Queens North Vice Enforcement Squad met at their base in College Point to discuss the seven locations they planned to hit that night. The closest target became the first: the bleak building at 135-32 40th Road.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\n在约会的这天，皇后区北区扫黄行动组的警员在他们位于大学点(College Point)的据点集合，讨论当晚将要打击的七个地点。最近的目标成了头一个：40路135-32号的那幢破旧公寓楼。\nThe vice officers went over their safety plan. They chose their identifying color of the day. They agreed upon the mission’s assorted distress signals and code words, including what the primary undercover officer would say to indicate that sex had been offered for money. Now they were ready.\n扫黄行动组警员们温习了安全方案。他们选定了当天的识别色，商定了这次任务的各种呼救信号和暗语，包括主卧底警员会用什么词来暗示已发生了出价提供性服务的情况。现在他们一切就绪。\nThe 10-member team headed out into the evening, unseasonably mild for late November. They parked along Prince Street, across from the White Bear dumpling place and just short of where the one-way street bends east to become 40th Road. The team leader and two arresting officers sat in the first car, with two more arresting officers in the second car. The third vehicle was for prisoner transport.\n10个人的行动组在夜色中出发，这天的气温暖和得不像11月底。他们把车停在王子街，白熊水饺店对面，再往前不远这条单行道向东一拐就是40路。组长和两名执行逮捕的警员坐第一辆车，另两名执行逮捕的警员坐在第二辆车里。第三辆车是押送囚犯的。\nThe team tested its recording device, which used Bluetooth to transmit one-way audio. No problem. The green light was given: Go.\n\r\n行动组测试了录音设备，这个设备通过蓝牙单向传输声音。没有问题。绿灯信号发出：行动。\nMinutes later, the undercover officer approached his target, Song Yang, just inside her building’s entrance. He wore an olive-green jacket, jeans and a cap. She wore a short winter coat, a red-and-black scarf, leggings and one of her signature headbands — with a small bow that resembled a butterfly.\n几分钟后，卧底警员接近了目标宋扬，她就在公寓楼门的里边。他穿着橄榄绿上衣和牛仔裤，戴着帽子。她穿着一件短冬衣，红黑两色围巾，紧身裤，还戴着一个标志性的发带——上面有个小小的蝴蝶结。\nThe officer could not have known that this woman had just attempted a video chat with her younger brother, who was still asleep in China. That she had plans to fly home in December. That she had kept her court-mandated appointments with Restore NYC, a nonprofit organization that helps foreign-born victims of sex trafficking. That her fifth and last session with Restore was four days away.\n警员不会知道这个女人刚刚试着跟她弟弟视频聊天，可他还在中国睡觉。他也不会知道她打算12月飞回国。他不会知道她一直按照法庭的强制要求，定期去纽约市恢复中心，一家援助外国出生的性交易受害者的非营利组织。他不会知道她在恢复中心要上的第五次、也是最后一次咨询辅导班的日子是四天之后。\nAbout all he knew was her police nickname for the night: “JD Ponytail.”\n他只知道那天晚上行动中她的警方代号：“JD Ponytail”。\nJane Doe Ponytail.\n马尾辫无名女。\nShe led him up the worn stairs. She gave him a peck of a kiss in the hall, and opened her apartment door. Another woman, brand-new to Flushing and known as Momo, was already occupied with a man in the second bedroom.\n她领他走上破旧的楼梯。在走廊里她亲了他一口，打开了自己房间的门。另一个新来法拉盛的、名叫沫沫的女人，已经在公寓的另一间卧室里接待客人了。\nSong Yang walked her client to her bedroom, where, according to the police, she offered sexual intercourse for the reduced price of $80. He consented to the arrangement and, heading to the bathroom, managed to utter the code word into his transmitter that a positive — that is, illegal — agreement had been reached. He also hoped to signal to colleagues that it was time to move in, but a wary Song Yang prevented him from having privacy, telling him to keep the bathroom door open.\n宋扬带着自己的客人走进她的卧室，据警方披露，她在卧室提出以80美元的打折价提供性交。他同意了这个价钱，然后走进浴室，设法向他的发送器报出暗语，表明“阳性”——也就是非法的——协定已经达成。他还想发信号告诉同伴是行动的时候了，但警觉的宋扬不让他有私密，叫他别关浴室门。\n“This is bad service,” the officer said.\n\r\n“你这服务很差啊，”警员说。\nOnce in the bedroom, Song Yang became even more suspicious. \nWhy aren’t you taking off your clothes? \nshe asked. \nAre you a cop?\n警员进到卧室里后，宋扬的疑心更重了。“你怎么不脱衣服呀？”她问。“你是警察吧？”\n \nNo\n, he answered. But he complained again about the service and grabbed his hat, prepared to leave. She pushed him out and closed the door.\n不是，他回答说。但他再次抱怨她的服务，抓起帽子要走人。她把他推了出去，关上了门。\nResponding to the undercover officer’s signal, the three idling police vehicles turned onto 40th Road, smack into its everlasting gridlock. Four officers got out and hustled to the building. Climbing the dreary stairs, they passed their undercover colleague, who pointed to Song Yang’s door as he descended — and as she watched on the monitor in her apartment.\n收到卧底警员的信号，空转着发动机待命的三辆警车拐上40路，扎进这条街上永远的拥堵。四名警员下车冲向公寓楼。爬上阴暗的楼梯时，他们与卧底警员擦身而过，他一边下楼一边指了指宋扬的房门——这时她正在房间里看着监视器。\nWith the police demanding that she open the door, and preparing to break it down, a panicked Song Yang hurried to the apartment’s north balcony. The other woman, Momo, emerged naked from her bedroom to investigate the noise, but hustled back to hide when she realized it was the police.\n就在警察要她开门，并准备破门而入的时候，惊慌失措的宋扬快步来到公寓的北阳台。那个叫沫沫的女子光着身子从她那件间卧室出来，看外面在吵什么，明白了是警察后赶忙躲进屋里。\nThe balcony was not equipped with surveillance cameras, leaving what happened next to the imagination. It is possible that Song Yang was hoping to escape, perhaps by reaching for a wire that ran vertically past her balcony. It is possible that she was trying to land on the protruding metal sign of the restaurant below. It is also possible that she intended to kill herself.\n阳台没有装监控摄像头，接下来发生的事情只能靠想象。宋扬可能想逃走，也许伸手去够了一根从阳台边竖着经过的电缆线。她也可能想跳到楼下餐厅伸到街上的金属招牌上。也可能她就是想自杀。\nIt is fact that she hit the pavement directly in front of the undercover officer she had pecked on the cheek just five minutes earlier. His supervisors say that the officer remains shaken to this day.\n事实是，她掉在了街上，就在那名卧底警员的眼前，仅仅五分钟前她还亲过他一口。他的上司说，这名警员至今惊魂未定。\nLater that night, while Song Yang was lying in a hospital bed with multiple fractures to her face, head and body, the police placed her under arrest. She died in the morning — and the arrest was, in the parlance of the police, “voided.”\n那夜稍晚的时候，当面部、头部及身体多处骨折的宋扬躺在医院病床上时，警方宣布将她逮捕。她在清晨死去——对她的逮捕，用警方的话说，也就“失效了”。\n\r\n翻译：Hongyu Li\r\n"
