"I used to think the word 鈥渇eminist鈥� reeked of insecurity. A woman who needed to state that she was equal to a man might as well be shouting that she was smart or brave. If you were, you wouldn鈥檛 need to say it. I thought this because back then, I was a Swedish woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was 9 when I first stepped into a Swedish school. Freshly arrived from Czechoslovakia, I was bullied by a boy for being an immigrant. My one friend, a tiny little girl, punched him in the face. I was impressed. In my former country, a bullied girl would tattle or cry. I looked around to see what my new classmates thought of my friend鈥檚 feat, but no one seemed to have noticed. It didn鈥檛 take long to understand that in Sweden, my power was suddenly equal to a boy鈥檚.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Czechoslovakia, women came home from a long day of work to cook, clean and serve their husbands. In return, those women were cajoled, ignored and occasionally abused, much like domestic animals. But they were mentally unstable domestic animals, like milk cows that could go berserk you if you didn鈥檛 know exactly how to handle them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, the housekeeping tasks were equally divided. Soon my own father was cleaning and cooking as well. Why? He had divorced my mother and married a Swedish woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs high school approached, the boys wanted to kiss us and touch us, and the girls became a group of benevolent queens dispensing favors. The more the boys wanted us, the more powerful we became. When a girl chose to bestow her favors, the lucky boy was envied and celebrated. Slut shaming? What鈥檚 a slut?\r\n\r\n\r\nCondoms were provided by the school nurse without question. Sex education taught us the dangers of venereal diseases and unwanted pregnancy, but it also focused on fun stuff like masturbation. For a girl to own her sexuality meant she owned her body, she owned herself. Women could do anything men did, but they could also 鈥� when they chose to 鈥� bear children. And that made us more powerful than men. The word 鈥渇eminist鈥� felt antiquated; there was no longer a use for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I moved to Paris at 15 to work as a model, the first thing that struck me was how differently the men behaved. They opened doors for me, they wanted to pay for my dinner. They seemed to think I was too delicate, or too stupid, to take care of myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of feeling celebrated, I felt patronized. I claimed my power the way I had learned in Sweden: by being sexuality assertive. But Frenchmen don鈥檛 work this way. In discos, I鈥檇 set my eye on an attractive stranger, and then dance my way over to let him know he was a chosen one. More often than not, he fled. And when he didn鈥檛 run, he asked how much I charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn France, women did have power, but a secret one, like a hidden stiletto knife. It was all about manipulation: the sexy vixen luring the man to do her bidding. It wasn鈥檛 until I reached the United States, at 18, and fell in love with an American man that I truly had to rearrange my cultural notions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt turned out most of America didn鈥檛 think of sex as a healthy habit or a bargaining tool. Instead, it was something secret. If I mentioned masturbation, ears went red. Orgasms? Men made smutty remarks, while women went silent. There was a fine line between the private and the shameful. A former gynecologist spoke of the weather when doing a pelvic exam, as if I were a Victorian maiden who鈥檇 rather not know where all my bits were.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn America, a woman鈥檚 body seemed to belong to everybody but herself. Her sexuality belonged to her husband, her opinion of herself belonged to her social circles, and her uterus belonged to the government. She was supposed to be a mother and a lover and a career woman (at a fraction of the pay) while remaining perpetually youthful and slim. In America, important men were desirable. Important women had to be desirable. That got to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Czech Republic, the nicknames for women, whether sweet or bitter, fall into the animal category: little bug, kitten, old cow, swine. In Sweden, women are rulers of the universe. In France, women are dangerous objects to treasure and fear. For better or worse, in those countries, a woman knows her place.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the American woman is told she can do anything and then is knocked down the moment she proves it. In adapting myself to my new country, my Swedish woman power began to wilt. I joined the women around me who were struggling to do it all and failing miserably. I now have no choice but to pull the word 鈥渇eminist鈥� out of the dusty drawer and polish it up.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Paulina Porizkova, and I am a feminist.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�3鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圥AULINA PORIZKOVA锛�\r\n鎴戞浘缁忚寰楋紝鈥滃コ鏉冧富涔夎�呪�濊繖涓瓧鐪兼湁缂轰箯瀹夊叏鎰熶箣瀚屻�備竴涓渶瑕佸绉拌嚜宸变笌鐢锋�у钩绛夌殑濂虫�э紝灏卞ソ姣旇楂樺懠鑷繁鏈夊鑱槑鎴栧媷鏁€�傚鏋滆繖鏄疄鎯咃紝浣犳牴鏈笉鐢ㄨ鍑烘潵銆傛垜杩欎箞鎯虫槸鍥犱负锛屽綋鏃舵垜鏄竴鍚嶇憺鍏稿コ鎬с��\r\n\r\n\r\n绗竴娆¤笍杩涗竴鎵�鐟炲吀瀛︽牎鏃讹紝鎴�9宀併�傚垰鍒氫粠鎹峰厠鏂礇浼愬厠杩囧幓鐨勬垜锛屽洜涓虹Щ姘戣韩浠借�岃涓�涓敺瀛╂璐熴�傛垜鐨勬湅鍙嬶紝涓�涓皬濂冲锛屼竴鎷虫墦鍦ㄩ偅涓敺瀛╄劯涓娿�傛垜鎯婂徆涓嶅凡銆傚湪鎴戜箣鍓嶇敓娲荤殑鍥藉锛屽コ瀛╁彈浜嗘璐熷彧浼氭墦灏忔姤鍛婃垨鍝常銆傛垜鍚戝洓鍛ㄥ紶鏈涳紝鎯宠鐬х灖鏂板悓瀛︿滑濡備綍鐪嬪緟鎴戞湅鍙嬬殑澹妇锛屼絾浼间箮娌℃湁璋佹敞鎰忓埌杩欎簨銆傛病杩囧涔呮垜灏辨槑鐧戒簡锛屽湪鐟炲吀锛屾垜绐佺劧鎷ユ湁浜嗗拰鐢峰瀛愬悓绛夌殑鏉冨姏銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄦ嵎鍏嬫柉娲涗紣鍏嬶紝宸ヤ綔浜嗕竴鏁村ぉ鐨勫コ浜哄洖瀹跺悗瑕佸仛楗�佹墦鎵�佹湇渚嶄笀澶�備綔涓哄洖鎶ワ紝杩欎簺濂充汉浼氳鍝勯獥銆佽蹇界暐锛屾湁鏃惰繕浼氳铏愬緟锛屽緢鍍忓鐣溿�備絾濂逛滑琚涓虹簿绁炵姸鎬佷笉绋冲畾鐨勫鐣滐紝灏卞儚鏄ザ鐗涳紝濡傛灉浣犺繕涓嶇煡閬撳浣曞浠樺畠浠紝瀹冧滑鏄細瀵逛綘鍙戠媯鐨勩��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄧ憺鍏革紝瀹跺姟娲绘槸骞冲潎鍒嗛厤鐨勩�傚緢蹇垜鑷繁鐨勭埗浜蹭篃寮�濮嬫墦鎵拰鍋氶キ浜嗐�備负浠�涔堬紵鍥犱负浠栬窡鎴戝濡堢浜嗗锛屽ǘ浜嗕竴涓憺鍏稿コ浜恒��\r\n\r\n\r\n蹇笂楂樹腑鐨勬椂鍊欙紝鐢峰浠兂瑕佷翰鍚诲拰瑙︾鎴戜滑锛屾垜浠コ瀛╂垚浜嗕竴缇ゆ柦鎭╃殑浠佹厛濂崇帇銆傜敺瀛╄秺鏄兂瑕佹帴杩戞垜浠紝鎴戜滑灏卞彉寰楄秺寮哄ぇ銆傚綋涓�涓コ瀛╅�夊畾鏂芥仼瀵硅薄鏃讹紝閭ｄ釜骞歌繍鐨勭敺瀛╀細琚尽鎱曘�佽绁濊春銆傜緸杈辫崱濡囷紵浠�涔堟槸鑽″锛�\r\n\r\n\r\n瀛︽牎鐨勬姢澹彁渚涢伩瀛曞鏃朵笉浼氫笢闂タ闂�傛�ф暀鑲插憡鐭ユ垜浠�х梾鍜屾剰澶栨��瀛曠殑鍗遍櫓锛屼絾涔熶細渚ч噸浜庝竴浜涙湁瓒ｇ殑浜嬫儏锛屾瘮濡傛墜娣�傚涓�涓コ瀛╂潵璇达紝鎷ユ湁鎬ф剰鍛崇潃濂规嫢鏈夎嚜宸辩殑韬綋锛屽ス鏄嚜宸辩殑涓讳汉銆傜敺浜哄仛鐨勪换浣曚簨鎯咃紝濂充汉閮藉彲浠ュ仛锛屼絾濡傛灉鎰挎剰鐨勮瘽锛屽ス浠繕鍙互鐢熷瀛愩�傝繖璁╂垜浠瘮鐢蜂汉鏇村己澶с�傚コ鎬т富涔夎�呰繖涓瘝缁欎汉浠ヨ繃鏃朵箣鎰燂紝瀹冨凡缁忔淳涓嶄笂鐢ㄥ満浜嗐��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n褰撴垜鍦�15宀侀偅骞翠互妯＄壒鐨勮韩浠芥惉鍒板反榛庢椂锛屽ご涓�浠朵护鎴戦渿鎯婄殑浜嬫儏灏辨槸锛岀敺浜虹殑琛屼簨鏂瑰紡绔熶細濡傛涓嶅悓銆備粬浠负鎴戝紑闂紝浠栦滑鎯宠涓烘垜鐨勬櫄椁愪拱鍗曘�備粬浠技涔庤涓烘垜澶剢寮憋紝鎴栧お鎰氳牏锛屾棤娉曠収椤惧ソ鑷繁銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鎴戞病鏈夎寰楀彈鍒版伃缁达紝鍙嶈�屾湁琚汉灞堝皧淇氨涔嬫劅銆傛垜浠ュ湪鐟炲吀瀛﹀埌鐨勬柟寮忓绀鸿嚜宸辩殑鏉冨姏锛氬湪鎬ф柟闈㈢Н鏋佷富鍔ㄣ�備絾娉曞浗鐢蜂汉浼间箮涓嶅悆杩欎竴濂椼�傚湪杩柉绉戣垶鍘咃紝鎴戜細鐩綇涓�涓湁鍚稿紩鍔涚殑闄岀敓浜猴紝璺崇潃鑸炲噾杩囧幓锛岃浠栫煡閬撲粬琚�変腑浜嗐�備絾浠栭�氬父閮戒細璺戞帀銆傚鏋滄病璺戯紝浠栦細闂垜瑕佷环澶氬皯銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n2010骞达紝瀹濈惓濞溌锋尝閲屽吂绉戝▋鍦ㄧ背鍏般�� \r\n\r\n鍦ㄦ硶鍥斤紝濂充汉鐨勭‘鏈夋潈鍔涳紝浣嗛偅鏄竴绉嶉殣绉樼殑鏉冨姏锛屽氨鍍忎竴鎶婃殫钘忕殑鐭墤銆備竴鍒囬兘鍦ㄤ簬鎿嶆帶锛氭�ф劅鐨勭嫄鐙哥簿寮曡鐢蜂汉鍚ス鐨勫惄鍜愩�傜洿鍒板湪18宀侀偅骞存姷杈剧編鍥斤紝骞朵笌涓�涓編鍥界敺浜哄潬鍏ョ埍娌筹紝鎴戞墠鐪熺殑涓嶅緱涓嶉噸鏂版暣鐞嗚嚜宸辩殑鏂囧寲瑙傚康銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浜嬪疄璇佹槑锛屽ぇ澶氭暟缇庡浗浜哄苟涓嶆妸鎬у綋浣滀竴绉嶅仴搴风殑涔犳儻鎴栬浠疯繕浠风殑宸ュ叿銆傝�屾槸瑙嗕箣涓烘煇绉嶇瀵嗙殑涓滆タ銆傚鏋滄垜鎻愯捣鎵嬫帆锛屽氨浼氭湁浜鸿�虫湹鍙戠孩銆傛�ч珮娼紵鐢蜂汉鍙戣〃鎯呰壊鐨勮瘎璁猴紝濂充汉鍒欓棴鍙ｄ笉瑷�銆傞殣绉佸拰缇炶�讳箣闂翠粎鏈変竴绾夸箣闅斻�備竴鍚嶅墠濡囦骇绉戝尰鐢熷仛鐩嗚厰妫�鏌ユ椂璋堣鐫�澶╂皵锛屽氨濂藉儚鎴戞槸缁村鍒╀簹鏃朵唬鐨勫皯濂筹紝瀹佹効涓嶇煡閬撹嚜宸辫韩涓婄殑闆堕浂纰庣閮藉湪鍝噷銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄧ編鍥斤紝涓�涓コ浜虹殑韬綋浼间箮灞炰簬鎵�鏈変汉锛岄櫎浜嗗ス鑷繁銆傚ス鐨勬�х埍灞炰簬濂圭殑涓堝か锛屽ス瀵硅嚜宸辩殑鐪嬫硶灞炰簬濂圭殑绀句氦鍦堬紝濂圭殑瀛愬鍒欏睘浜庢斂搴溿�傚ス搴旇鏄竴涓瘝浜层�佷竴涓儏浜轰互鍙婁竴涓亴涓氬コ鎬э紙鍙嬁涓�灏忛儴鍒嗗伐璧勶級锛屽悓鏃舵案杩滀繚鎸佸勾杞诲拰鑻楁潯銆傚湪缇庡浗锛屼妇瓒宠交閲嶇殑鐢锋�т护浜虹寰�銆備妇瓒宠交閲嶇殑濂虫�у垯蹇呴』妤氭鍔ㄤ汉銆傝繖涓�鐐硅鎴戞伡鐏��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄦ嵎鍏嬪叡鍜屽浗锛屽コ浜虹殑鏄电О涓嶈鐢滅編杩樻槸闅惧惉锛岄兘闅惧厤钀藉叆鍔ㄧ墿鑼冪暣锛氬皬铏�佸皬鐚�佽�佺墰銆佺尓銆傚湪鐟炲吀锛屽コ浜烘槸瀹囧畽鐨勪富瀹般�傚湪娉曞浗锛屽コ浜烘槸浠や汉鏃㈢弽瑙嗗張瀹虫�曠殑鍗遍櫓鍝併�備笉绠℃�庢牱锛屽湪杩欎簺鍥藉閲岋紝濂充汉鐭ラ亾鑷繁鐨勪綅缃��\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗙編鍥藉コ浜轰竴闈㈣鍛婄煡濂瑰彲浠ュ仛浠讳綍浜嬶紝涓�闈㈠湪璇佹槑杩欎竴鐐规椂琚墦鍊掑湪鍦般�傞�傚簲杩欎釜鏂板湴鏂圭殑杩囩▼涓紝鎴戣韩涓婄憺鍏稿コ浜哄紡鐨勫己澶т箣鎰熷紑濮嬭悗缂┿�傛垜鍔犲叆浜嗗懆鍥撮偅浜涘コ浜虹殑琛屽垪鈥斺�斿ス浠鍔涘彉寰楁棤鎵�涓嶈兘锛屽嵈鎯ㄩ伃澶辫触銆傛垜鐜板湪鍒棤閫夋嫨锛屽彧濂戒粠灏樺皝鐨勬娊灞夐噷鎷藉嚭鈥滃コ鎬т富涔夎�呪�濊繖涓瘝锛屽苟鎶婂畠鎿﹀緱閿冧寒銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鎴戠殑鍚嶅瓧鍙繚鍒╁路娉㈠埄鏂濞�(Paulina Porizkova)锛屾垜鏄竴鍚嶅コ鎬т富涔夎�呫��\r\n\r\n\r\n瀹濈惓濞溌锋尝閲屽吂绉戝▋(Paulina Porizkova)鏇炬槸涓�浣嶈秴妯★紝钁楁湁灏忚銆婃ā鐗圭殑澶忓ぉ銆�(A Model Summer)銆�\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氭潕鐞�"
