"编辑:给力英语新闻  更新:2017年1月7日 作者:美国之音双语新闻(VOA News)\r\n美国国会议员正式清点了选举人票，验证共和党候选人唐纳德·川普当选为第45任美国总统。\r\n对选举人票进行清点是将2016年11月8日全国大选结果合法化的最后一步。验证选举人票是副总统的职责。这意味着，副总统拜登主次了星期五的国会联席点票。\r\n点票期间，众议院中的民主党人拒绝接受至少10个州报上来的选举人票，因为有抱怨说，选举中出现了压制选民投票以及认为俄罗斯有可能通过网络操纵来干扰选举结果的情况。\r\n联邦法律规定，每一次提出反对，都须得到国会另一院一个成员的支持才能提交讨论。但是，当众议院成员提出反对时，参议员们却保持了沉默，因此拜登每次都必须回应说：“不能有任何辩论。”\r\n选举人票的最后点票结果是：川普获得304票，民主党候选人希拉里·克林顿获得227票。7名选举人投下了“抗议票”，选择其他候选人。点票完毕之后，副总统拜登正式宣布川普胜选。\r\n候选人需要获得270张选举人票才能赢得总统职位。川普远远超过了这个门槛，不过，如果按照全国范围选民直接投票的票数计算，克林顿比川普多出了近290万张选票。\r\n川普和他的当选副总统麦克·彭斯将于1月20日（星期五）宣誓就职。这是行政权力交接的最后一步。\r\nMembers of the U.S. Congress have officially counted Electoral College votes and verified Donald Trump's election as the 45th U.S. president.\r\n\r\nThe electoral vote count is the final step in legitimizing the results of the national vote held on November 8, 2016. It is the responsibility of the vice president to certify the vote of the Electoral College, which meant Vice President Joe Biden presided over Friday's joint session of Congress.\r\nDuring the vote count, Democratic members of the House of Representatives objected to votes reported from at least 10 states, because of complaints about voter suppression and the belief that Russia used online influence to tamper with election results.\r\nFederal law mandates that an objection must be supported by a member of the other house of Congress in order to be discussed. When House members raised objections, senators stayed quiet, so in each case Biden was obliged to respond by saying, \"There can be no debate.\"\r\nToward the end of the count, Representative Maxine Waters, an African-American member of the Democratic Party from California, pleaded for at least one senator to stand up in support of her objection. In answer, Republicans booed.\r\nProtesters also attended the joint session, in the public seating area. Several were ejected when their behavior become disruptive.\r\nThe final electoral count was 304 votes for Trump and 227 for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Seven electors registered \"protest votes\" for other candidates. Biden made the formal announcement declaring Trump the winner after the count was complete.\r\nTrump and his vice president-elect, Mike Pence, will be sworn into office on January 20."
