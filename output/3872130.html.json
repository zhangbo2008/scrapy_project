Seeing your house full of clutter can affect your mood negatively and make your personal space seem like a place you want to escape from, rather than something to look forward to coming home to. Organize a \"throwing out\" day every month to make sure that you don't have clutter building up. Here are some things you should consider purging from your home:\n　　照顾好自己并减轻压力的第一步就是要确保你的环境处于有序状态。乱糟糟的屋子会让你的心情变遭，让你的个人空间看起来像是你想逃离的地方，而不是你期待回家的地方。每月安排一天“扔掉日”，以免你的杂物堆成山。下面的这几种东西，你该考虑一下，把它们从家中移走。\n　　Old magazines\n　　旧杂志\n　　Get rid of old magazines you have lying around because chances are, you aren't going to read them again. Find places where you can donate your magazines to such as child care centers, doctor's offices, nail salons, nursing homes, and libraries. If there's an article that really speaks to you, scan a digital image of it and keep it in your computer. Or keep a folder of magazine clippings if you like saving magazine articles.\n　　把成堆的旧杂志移走吧。因为你很有可能不会再看它们了。找一些可以捐出杂志的地方，如儿童护理中心、医生办公室、美甲沙龙、育婴房和图书馆等。如果杂志里有一篇文章说出了你的心声，可以用扫描仪扫描成电子版本，把它存到电脑中。或者，如果你喜欢保存杂志文章，可以把杂志剪报保留到文件夹中。\n　　Receipts, bills, and documents\n　　收据、账单及文档\n　　Throw away receipts for items that you aren't planning on returning, and ones that you won't need to use come tax time. If you're wary of throwing away receipts, you can make a digital copy of them with a basic scanner, a pricey specialized receipt scanner, or a smartphone app.\n　　扔掉你不准备退货的商品收据以及缴税时不需要用的收据。如果你担心收据会有用，你可以用扫描仪、收据专用扫描仪、或手机应用软件把收据转成电子版。\n　　Clothes\n　　衣服\n　　Use the two-year-rule for clothes ― get rid of apparel that you haven't worn in two years. Sell them to a thrift store or donate them to the needy.\n　　使用两年规则――把你两年内没穿过的衣服清理掉。把它们卖给二手店或把它们捐给有需要的人。\n　　Books\n　　图书\n　　Go through your bookshelf and gather together books you haven't touched in months and ones that you aren't planning on rereading. Be realistic and make sure you're ruthless. If you haven't touched it in a year, you're most likely not going to read it again.\n　　去看看你的书架，把你几个月没碰过的书和你不打算重读的书放到一起。实事求是，果断些。如果你一年内也没碰过那本书，很有可能不会再去看它。\n　　Medicine and vitamins\n　　药物和维生素\n　　Take a look at your medicine closet and clear out drugs that have expired, medicine that has sat on your shelf for too long, or ones that you no longer use. First, check to see what the proper disposal methods are for the medication, and if you can't find any, check to see if your community has a drug take-back program.\n　　看看你的药箱，把过期的药、在药箱里呆的时间过长的药或你不再会用的药清除出去。首先，看看药物的的恰当处置方法，如果你找不到，那就去看看你的社区是否有药物回收活动。Makeup and perfume\n　　化妆品和香水\n　　Go through your beauty cabinet and get rid of makeup that's too old or that you don't use. There are programs out there that let you recycle your makeup, such as MAC, which has a program that lets you exchange six empty containers for a new eyeshadow, lip gloss, or lipstick. Kiehl's also has a program that gives you products in exchange for Kiehl's containers. POPSUGAR Beauty has a neat list of when to throw away cosmetics.\n　　翻翻化妆箱，把时间太长或不用的化妆品拿出来。有很多回收化妆品的活动：如MAC就有一个活动，拿六个空罐子就能换到新的眼影膏、唇彩或唇膏;Kiehl’s也有一个活动，你可以拿Kiehl’s的罐子交换产品;Popsugar Beauty有一张清单，简洁说明了何时该扔掉化妆品。\n　　Jewelry\n　　珠宝\n　　Go through your jewelry and dispose of the broken costume jewelry and make plans to sell ones that you don't wear. For fine jewelry, look up appraisers from the National Association of Jewelry Appraisers. Once you have a quoted price, shop around at auction houses, pawnshops, and jewelers to see if you can find a better deal.\n　　把你的珠宝里坏了的人造珠宝扔掉，并做做计划卖掉你不佩戴的珠宝。要是想卖高品质珠宝的话，查查国家珠宝评估师协会的评估师。一旦有报价了，去拍卖行、当铺和珠宝店里货比三家， 看看能否有更划算的交易。\n　　Food\n　　食物\n　　Go through your pantry and fridge and clear out items that need to be thrown out ― the old, unused, and rotting. Do this weekly instead of monthly, just to make sure you don't have any unpleasant surprises!\n　　翻翻你的食品储藏室和冰箱，把需要扔掉的东西――时间长了的、不想吃了的、腐烂的食物清除出去。这一项要每周做一次，而不是每月做一次，来确保你不会有任何不愉快的意外!\n　　Some memorabilia\n　　一些纪念品\n　　Many organizing experts advise to be ruthless and throw away memorabilia like cards and gifts you don't use. I agree, but I think you can keep some of them by perhaps creating some sort of poster with old cards or designating a small shoe box for memorabilia. Resolve to throw away anything that can't fit into the box.\n　　很多整理专家建议要果断一些，把不用的诸如卡品和小礼物之类的纪念品扔掉。我同意这样做，但我认为你可以留下一些，可以用旧卡片来创作海报或指定一个小鞋盒来装纪念品。下定决心，把盒子里装不下的东西都扔掉。\n　　Notebooks\n　　笔记本\n　　I don't know about you, but I have a ton of notebooks lying around. Take a look at them and throw out the ones that you no longer need. My notebooks are filled with notes from classes I take and notes from meetings.\n　　我不知道你是不是这样，反正我周围有一大堆笔记本。翻翻它们，把不再需要的笔记本扔掉。我的笔记本上面都是上课的笔记和开会的记录。"
