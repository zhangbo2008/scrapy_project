"编辑:给力英语新闻  更新:2017年1月7日 作者:美国之音双语新闻(VOA News)\r\n白宫已指示所有政治任命的美国大使在1月20日总统就职日之前辞职。\r\n美国国务院发言人科比星期五说：“这是通常和典型的做法。”他证实，作为美国外事局职业外交官的大使－占美国驻外高层特使的大约百分之70－没有被要求辞职。\r\n美国外交政策学院院长院长罗纳德·诺依曼表示，政治任命的大使被撤回，是因为他们是即将离任的奥巴马总统政府的代表。\r\n科比说：“如果你是本届或其它任何一届政府的政治任命人员，你就不要期待会留任到新政府就职日之后。”\r\n川普已经下令所有政治任命的大使在总统就职日之前离职。\r\n当选总统川普过渡团队的工作人员早些时候发布了一道统一指令，并作为国务院的电报发出，该指令命所有政治任命人员在总统就职日之前离开他们驻外职位。\r\n《纽约时报》说，该指令似乎打破了数十年的先例，因为它规定所有受到影响的大使不能有最短的延期，比如完成孩子的学期或处理家庭健康问题等。\r\n当选总统川普过渡团队的一名资深人员告诉该报，此举没有恶意，他形容这么做仅仅是确保奥巴马总统任命的驻外使节，与白宫和联邦机构数千名政治助理们一样，能够按期离职。\r\n诺依曼说，极少数非职业大使请求延期，通常也只是请求短暂延期，延期请求一般视各案情况而定。\r\nThe White House has directed all U.S. ambassadors who are political appointees to resign their posts as of Inauguration Day, January 20.\r\n“That is common, typical practice,” State Department spokesman John Kirby said Friday, and he confirmed that ambassadors who are career members of the U.S. Foreign Service — about 70 percent of the top American envoys abroad — were not asked to offer their resignations.\r\n“The politically appointed ambassadors are being pulled back because they are the representatives of the outgoing administration” of President Barack Obama, according to the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, Ronald Neumann.\r\n“When you are a political appointee for this or any other administration, you have no expectation of staying beyond the inauguration of the new administration,” Kirby said.\r\nTrump ordered all out by Inauguration Day\r\nIn the background of this week’s developments, however, is the disclosure that President-elect Donald Trump’s transition staff issued a blanket order earlier, distributed as a diplomatic cable by the State Department, ordering all political appointees to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day.\r\nThe New York Times said the order appeared to break with decades of precedent by indicating that affected ambassadors would not get even the briefest extension of their appointments, for reasons such as completing a child’s school term or dealing with family health issues.\r\nA senior member of Trump’s transition team told the Times there was no ill will in the move, describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Obama’s overseas envoys leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do.\r\nVery few noncareer ambassadors seek such extensions, and usually only on a short-term basis, Neumann added. The American Academy of Diplomacy that he heads is made up of former career and noncareer U.S. government officials who have served in international affairs."
