Currently under construction in a new condominium building in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Ms. Stevens鈥檚 new school will be called Mozarts and Einsteins, a name presumably selected after a period of deliberation during which other names like 鈥淪travinskys and Zuckerbergs鈥� were submitted to focus groups and turned down.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning in September, the school will house 40 children, ages 2 to 5, who will move from classroom to classroom for 35 hours a week to study math, science, reading, piano, dance, art, jazz, percussion, ballet, drama, singing and Spanish. Ms. Stevens herself is not an idler, having worked as a music teacher, entrepreneur, business consultant and writer. Recently, she wrote a book called 鈥淏ecome a Time Millionaire: 100 Ways to Gain an Extra Hour a Day,鈥� spending her own days on 鈥渉igh dividend activities.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nArguably of course, this is the whole problem with modern child-rearing 鈥� this focus on yield, on a kind of application of 鈥淭he 7 Habits of Highly Effective People鈥� mentality to people whose habits still include crying during the vaguely ominous bits of 鈥淪hrek.鈥� As it happens 鈥� and possibly signaling that brownstone Brooklyn has not been thoroughly Manhattanized 鈥� Mozarts and Einsteins has not yet been besieged by hundreds of applications or an assault of its doors. Only six children are enrolled so far, Linda Steele, the admissions director, told me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are too many parenting trends filling the air at any moment to declare one particularly dominant or singular, but there are inklings in the city 鈥� or at least in parts of it 鈥� of a movement toward slow parenting, analogous to the movement toward slow food. The past several years have seen a revival of the Waldorf philosophy, which promotes learning by creative play and imitation in the early years and holding off on reading until the age of 7 or so. You will hear Brooklyn mothers quote the parenting guru Kim John Payne, author of a book called 鈥淪implicity Parenting,鈥� which advocates for fewer possessions, less scheduling and so on. In recent years, Waldorf schools have opened in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and on the Lower East Side.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, a woman named Joylynn Holder and her husband, Charlie Foster, both graduates of a Waldorf school on Long Island, started a program called Brooklyn Forest, a series of classes with a Waldorf influence held for toddlers in Prospect Park, where the agenda doesn鈥檛 much deviate from getting dirty and making teepees with found branches. The program began with seven students, now has 200, and is planning to expand to Central Park.\r\n\r\n\r\nForest schools have become a popular feature of European education over the past two decades and you will find them in Holland and Scandinavia and other places that venerate aesthetically unimpeachable wooden toys. In Brooklyn, children arrive looking as though they are professional fishermen and dig into mud, make mud pies, look for worms and handle worms. Sometimes, as I witnessed observing the weekday classes, which are 90 minutes long, they will attempt to eat worms. This is discouraged. Also discouraged is instructing children to say thank you. The idea is that they should learn manners from seeing them modeled rather than from being told to perform them 鈥� sincerity in all things.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren are guided rather than explicitly directed from one step to another 鈥� from mud pie making to hand washing, for instance 鈥� through song, because song, or soft song specifically, is understood to becalm. Snacks consist of the whole wheat bread Mr. Foster bakes for every class. The bread is accompanied by sliced apples and Saskatoon berry tea, ordered from Canada and drunk from tiny white ceramic cups, all served from the back of an all-terrain Red Flyer. Completing the picture, Ms. Holder and her husband, both in their early 30s, could easily serve as good-looking Brooklyn鈥檚 ambassadors to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this might suggest that the pair are tiresomely earnest, or cultishly ideological, or insufferable 鈥� but they aren鈥檛. Ms. Holder has not bought into every alternative idea, calling, for instance, the simplicity parenting movement, which has workshops and seminars, 鈥渒ind of pyramid scheme-y.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚t鈥檚 a big thing in Waldorf schools for children to remain in a bubble,鈥� Ms. Holder explained as we were entering the park with a group of children. 鈥淭he bubble!
