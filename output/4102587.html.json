She has already hit the treadmill in an attempt to shed the pounds.\n　　斗牛犬黛西来自米德尔斯堡市，体重4英石6磅(约27.86公斤)，超过其正常体重的50%。为了减肥，她已经在用跑步机了。Poppy is a third heavier than she should be at more than 7lb C mainly due to a taste for popcorn.\n　　而兔子波比体重7磅(3.15公斤)以上，超过自身正常体重三分之一，肥胖的罪魁祸首在于它太爱吃爆米花了。\n　　Other candidates include a cat that can open the fridge and a Jack Russell with a taste for doner kebabs.\n　　其他参与减肥的宠物还包括一只能打开冰箱门偷吃的猫、以及一只爱吃烤肉串的杰克罗素狗。\n　　According to the PDSA, pet obesity levels are at worryingly high levels. Around one in three dogs and one in four cats are said to be overweight.\n　　据英国人民兽医药房消息，宠物的肥胖水平现在十分堪忧。据说有三分之一的狗和四分之一的猫都有肥胖问题。\n　　Zorro, a three-year-old ginger Tom from Dundee, has a whopping 63cm waist and is double the size he should be, weighing a hefty 9.4kg.\n　　佐罗是一只三岁的姜黄色猫咪，生活在敦提市。他腰部巨粗，腰围达63厘米，体型是正常猫咪身体的两倍大，体重有9.4公斤。\n　　Devoted owner, Linda Petrie, 51, who adopted Zorro a year ago, now has to use baby wipes to keep her moggy clean, as he struggles to groom himself due to his size.\n　　他的主人琳达・皮特里今年51岁了，她是去年收养的佐罗，现在不得不用婴儿湿巾给佐罗做清洁工作。因为佐罗体型巨大，洗澡的时候又挣扎不听话，所以清洁起来十分困难。Linda says that his eating habits have also become a bit of a pain: he is very demanding and often wakes Linda in the middle of the night for his favourite snack, cheese and onion crisps.\n　　琳达说，佐罗的饮食习惯也很让人痛苦：他食欲很强，经常为了向主人要自己喜欢的零食、奶酪和洋葱薯片吃，而在深更半夜吵醒琳达。\n　　PDSA Pet Fit Club was launched in 2005 and has already helped 57 dogs, 24 cats and 3 rabbits lose a total of 295kg (46 stone 6lb).\n　　英国人民兽医药房组织的宠物健身俱乐部是在2005年创办的，已经帮助57条狗、24只猫咪和3只兔子减去了总计295公斤的重量。\n　　This weight loss is the equivalent of nearly 300 bags of sugar, more than 4,400 sausages, 740 tins of dog food or over 1,000 blocks of lard.\n　　这些减去的重量相当于300袋糖、4400多条火腿、740听狗粮或者1000块猪油。\n　　Senior Veterinary Surgeon, Andy Cage, from Dundee PetAid hospital, said that having over weight animals is not just a nuisance, it is also an issue of cruelty.\n　　邓迪宠物急救医院的高级兽医安迪・凯奇说，饲养肥胖宠物不仅很令人讨厌、甚至是十分残酷的问题。\n　　'Obesity is one of the biggest welfare issues affecting pets in the UK today. Sadly, it also means millions of pets are at risk from potentially life-threatening health problems related to obesity. But the good news is that obesity is entirely reversible.'\n　　“肥胖是当今英国影响宠物福利健康的问题。因为，这意味着上百万的宠物都面临着由肥胖引起的潜在生命健康问题。但好消息是，肥胖问题是完全可以解决的。”"
