In February, a federal grand jury indicted the group over allegations of interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\r\n\n调查人员表示，这些账户可能与一个名为“互联网研究机构”的组织有关，该组织总部位于俄罗斯圣彼得堡。今年2月，一个联邦大陪审团指控该组织干预2016年美国总统选举。\r\n\n\r\nGleicher called the recent discovery \"a timely reminder that these bad actors won't give up — and why it is so important we work with the U.S. government and other technology companies to stay ahead.\"\r\n\n格莱歇尔称，最近的发现“及时提醒我们，这些坏人不会放弃，我们与美国政府和其他科技公司合作保持领先是很重要的。”\r\n\n\r\nBefore Gleicher's statement, the Internet Research Agency said in a statement that it was responsible for the accounts, although that has not been verified.\r\n\n在格莱歇尔发表声明前，互联网研究机构在一份声明中宣布对这些账户负责，不过这一说法尚未得到证实。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nIn its statement, the organization said, \"Citizens of the United States of America!

Facebook also recently banned 82 accounts linked to Iran, that were posting politically charged memes.\r\n\n今年4月，脸书关闭了约270个与这家互联网研究机构有关的账户。脸书最近还屏蔽了82个与伊朗有关的账户，因为这些账户发布了带有政治色彩的表情包。\r\n\r\r\n\r\n\r\n"
