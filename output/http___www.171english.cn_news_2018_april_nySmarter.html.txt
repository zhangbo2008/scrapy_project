But an interesting new study asks whether the apparent cognitive benefits from exercise are real or just a placebo effect 鈥� that is, if we think we will be 鈥渟marter鈥� after exercise, do our brains respond accordingly? The answer has significant implications for any of us hoping to use exercise to keep our minds sharp throughout our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn experimental science, the best, most reliable studies randomly divide participants into two groups, one of which receives the drug or other treatment being studied and the other of which is given a placebo, similar in appearance to the drug, but not containing the active ingredient.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacebos are important, because they help scientists to control for people鈥檚 expectations. If people believe that a drug, for example, will lead to certain outcomes, their bodies may produce those results, even if the volunteers are taking a look-alike dummy pill. That鈥檚 the placebo effect, and its occurrence suggests that the drug or procedure under consideration isn鈥檛 as effective as it might seem to be; some of the work is being done by people鈥檚 expectations, not by the medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently, some scientists have begun to question whether the apparently beneficial effects of exercise on thinking might be a placebo effect. While many studies suggest that exercise may have cognitive benefits, those experiments all have had a notable scientific limitation: They have not used placebos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue is not some abstruse scientific debate. If the cognitive benefits from exercise are a result of a placebo effect rather than of actual changes in the brain because of the exercise, then those benefits could be ephemeral and unable in the long term to help us remember how to spell ephemeral.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudying this issue, however, is difficult. There is no placebo for exercise and no way to blind people about whether they are exercising. They know if they are walking or cycling or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo researchers at Florida State University in Tallahassee and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign came up with a clever workaround. They decided to focus on expectations, on what people anticipate that exercise will do for thinking. If people鈥檚 expectations jibe closely with the actual benefits, then at least some of those improvements are probably a result of the placebo effect and not of exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scientists had seen this situation at work during an earlier study of video games and cognition. Past research had suggested that playing action-oriented video games improves players鈥� subsequent thinking skills. But when scientists in the new study asked video-game players to estimate by how much the games would improve their thinking, the players鈥� estimates almost exactly matched the gains seen on cognitive tests after playing. In other words, the cognitive benefits of playing video games appear to be largely a result of a placebo effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the new study, which was published last month in PLOS One, the researchers repeated this experiment but focused on exercise. Recruiting 171 people through an online survey system, they asked half of these volunteers to estimate by how much a stretching and toning program performed three times a week might improve various measures of thinking, including memory and mental multitasking.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other volunteers were asked the same questions, but about a regular walking program.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn actual experiments, stretching and toning regimens generally have little if any impact on people鈥檚 cognitive skills. Walking, on the other hand, seems to substantially improve thinking ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the survey respondents believed the opposite, estimating that the stretching and toning program would be more beneficial for the mind than walking. The volunteers鈥� estimates of the likely cognitive improvements from gentle toning averaged about a three on a scale from one to six. The estimates of benefits from walking were lower.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese data, while they do not involve any actual exercise, are good news for people who do exercise. 鈥淭he results from our study suggest that the benefits of aerobic exercise are not a placebo effect,鈥� said Cary Stothart, a graduate student in cognitive psychology at Florida State University, who led the study.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf expectations had been driving the improvements in cognition seen in studies after exercise, Mr. Stothart said, then people should have expected walking to be more beneficial for thinking than stretching. They didn鈥檛, implying that the changes in the brain and thinking after exercise are physiologically genuine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, this study was small and involved a self-selected group of people who happen to like completing online surveys. Some said they exercised, others said they did not. None claimed to be familiar with the science related to exercise and the brain, but it is impossible to know if people were being forthright.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, the findings are strong enough to suggest that exercise really does change the brain and may, in the process, improve thinking, Mr. Stothart said. That conclusion should encourage scientists to look even more closely into how, at a molecular level, exercise remodels the human brain, he said. It also should spur the rest of us to move, since the benefits are, it seems, not imaginary, even if they are in our head.\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圙RETCHEN REYNOLDS锛�\r\nExercise seems to be good for the human brain, with many recent studies suggesting that regular exercise improves memory and thinking skills.
