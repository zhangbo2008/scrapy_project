"Many people in the West have never even heard of the pangolin, yet this “scaly anteater” is the source of a billion-dollar criminal industry that threatens to push it to extinction. BBC Future met a team of Hong Kong’s ecologists and activists trying to save these creatures from extinction.\nFor millions of years, the pangolin’s natural reserve had been its best defence. The only mammal with hard, plate-like scales, it looks something like a badger in chainmail – and at the merest hint of danger, the pangolin simply roles up into a tight ball that is nearly impossible for a predator to penetrate. The shell is so tough that it can even resist the teeth of lions, tigers and leopards.\nNot that many scientists have even been able to witness this behaviour themselves. There are eight species of pangolin across Asia and Africa, and they are all nocturnal, and notoriously shy, hiding in burrows and hollow trees for most of the day. Even conservationists working extensively in their natural habitats often struggle to catch sight of one. “I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who’s seen a wild pangolin,” says Timothy Bonebrake, a biologist at Hong Kong University (HKU). \nThis natural shyness may help the pangolin to hide from a careful conservationist, but it is no match for the more determined poacher. Using its distinctive footprint – the front claw curves inwards as it walks – to identify a local population, the hunter can then use trained dogs to sniff them out of their burrows, or a trap to capture them as they snuffle for food at night. Bonebrake remembers seeing the poachers at the side of the road in Cameroon, holding the pangolins by their tails as they flaunted them for sale.\nDecades ago, those animals may have just ended up in the local market; today, the majority are exported thousands of miles across the globe. Most consumers come from mainland China and Vietnam, where the keratin scales are an important ingredient for traditional medicines, and the meat is often prized as a delicacy at banquets. Ideally, the live pangolin is presented at the dinner table before the chef slits its throat in front of the guests, as a guarantee of the meat’s freshness. And as the pangolin populations in Asia dwindle, more and more are now being captured in Africa to meet the demand.\n \nIn total, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature estimates that a million pangolins may have crossed international borders in the last decade – making them the world’s most trafficked mammal.\nIf this continues, extinction will be inevitable. Natural populations are already half their number at the beginning of the millennium, and a series of large seizures during the past year would suggest that the demand is only increasing. “It’s very difficult to tell, but it seems like trade has crescendoed,” says Alexandra Andersson, an ecology PhD student at HKU and consultant for Humane Society International. “It’s mindboggling how much is coming through.”\nThe wider environmental repercussions of this loss are largely unknown. “We’re seeing these declines in pangolins but will it have an effect on the ecosystems? We don’t know,” says Bonebrake. “But it could be that pangolins are really important.” Each pangolin is thought to eat 70 million ants and termites a year, for instance. “That’s pretty critical in terms of the ecosystem turnover.” Without this natural pest control, those areas may soon be overrun with insects.\nCompared to the dangers facing elephants, rhinos or tigers, however, the plight of the pangolin has failed to penetrate the public consciousness, particularly in the West. “It’s only in the last year or two that people have started to realise that pangolins are in trouble,” says Bonebrake. As the UK’s Prince William baldly put it, “the pangolin runs the risk of becoming extinct before most people have even heard of them”.\nSo how did this elusive, reticent creature become the focus of this billion-dollar industry? And what can be done to save it? To find out, I visited Bonebrake and Andersson in HKU’s “conservation forensics lab” – a group with a unique view of all kinds of animal trafficking.\nAs I soon discover, there are few better places to study wildlife crime: for various geographical, cultural, political and economic reasons, Hong Kong is a hub for the trafficking of many different endangered species. The rising threat facing the pangolin only makes sense in this broader context.\nI first meet Andersson in the Sheung Wan district, a 30-minute walk from the university. Along the way, she leads me past shop after shop selling shark’s fin and other forms of dried seafood. Like pangolin meat, the shark’s fin soup is often considered the centrepiece of a banquet. Its texture – a kind of “strandy silkiness” with a “gelatinous bite”, according to food writer Fuchsia Dunlop – may be part of the attraction; but so is the sheer expense of hunting and killing the shark, making it a symbol of wealth and power. “Emperors used to eat it as a delicacy, and it’s become popular because people want to demonstrate their status,” says Andersson.\nAlthough some shark’s fins are legal in Hong Kong, products from species such as the hammerhead are banned. Unfortunately, it’s currently very difficult to determine a fin's origins – making these shops the most visible front of the city’s illegal wildlife trade. “Short of testing each fin I don’t know what you can do,” says Andersson.\nOther goods are specifically valued for their medicinal properties. Alongside the shark fins we see dried fish bladders – or “maws” – hanging from the shop ceilings. The maws are traditionally used to cure joint pains and ease the discomfort of pregnancy and are even said to be aphrodisiacs. Again, certain species’ maws are legal, while the trade of other endangered species has been banned – but the stratospheric prices mean some traders are willing to take the risk. The trade of one particularly sought-after species of Mexican fish, the totoaba, is apparently as lucrative as cocaine.\nThe pangolin’s extinction may arise from similar (scientifically unproven) beliefs. The animal’s scales are simply made from keratin, the same stuff as fingernails and hair, meaning they should have little nutritional value, but practitioners of Chinese medicine believe that they can cure a number of ills. The benefits are thought to arise, in part, from their behaviour in the wild. “The first medical use of pangolin scales was to treat ant stings – because they eat ants,” says Cheng Wenda, a PhD student in Bonebrake’s lab. “And because pangolins dig holes, they believe they can open some blockage in your body.” Perhaps for these reasons, some practitioners claim the scales can improve fertility and that they can even fight cancer.\nThese beliefs are deeply embedded in the culture, and many residents in Hong Kong continue to follow the ancient recipes – as Andersson showed with a recent survey. “We found that 85% of the respondents thought that pangolin scales had medicinal value, even though there is no peer-reviewed evidence for this.”\nAs with the shark fins, there had been some confusion about which pangolin species could be imported: until recently, it was legal to trade certain quantities ofthe African species, but it was very hard for law enforcers or consumers to verify the source. That changed with a new ruling of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species in late 2016, which now protects all species equally. “That was a very big win – now it’s as clear as day, black and white,” says Andersson. Even so, she suspects that a few of the shops we pass may be trading in the scales, although we would have to work hard to gain their trust before the traders would admit it openly.\nIn any case, most of the imported animals pass through Hong Kong to the rest of China. Its status as a ‘free port’ – a legacy of British occupation – has meant that customs regulations are traditionally lax, and its location makes it an easy route to the nearby Guangdong province, where demand is particularly high. The region is famed for its ‘wild flavour’ cuisine, including the use of bush meats – although the use of more controversial ingredients is often sheathed in secrecy. Andersson, for instance, remembers enquiring about the possibility of eating pangolin meat at a restaurant in Guangzhou. “They initially said yeah, we can organise that for you,” Andersson says – only for the waiter to return, pretending that he had no recollection of the conversation.\nAfter our walk through the shark fin shops, Andersson takes me to her university department, where her colleagues help to explain why the illegal trade of animals – including pangolins – continues unabated. The primary explanation may be the rocketing Chinese economy, and the resulting consumerism, they say. “Whether it’s for medicinal use, or status – there are different reasons depending on what it is – more people want more stuff, and they’ve got more money to be able to buy it,” says Yvonne Sadovy, who is working on the conservation of threatened marine life.\nThis economic boom has also created a backbone of international trading links through China’s increasing investments abroad. Bonebrake witnessed this through his work in Cameroon, where Chinese investors are pouring money into the local infrastructure, in return for increased access to natural resources, like the local timber.\nThe cultural and economic connections between the two countries are impossible to ignore, he says. “Where I stay in Yaoundé in Cameroon – in that part of town, there are Chinese hotels, Chinese restaurants – all the writing’s in Chinese,” he says. “And every time you see a new road, you say, ‘where did this come from?’ And it’s the Chinese that built it.”\nAll of which allows the traders to slip in their illegal goods along with the legitimate imports. “There’s so much back and forth between these areas – it’s actually not such a big deal if you have some pangolin scales in one of the shipping containers,” he adds. “A lot of these huge pangolin seizures are just a consequence of the natural resources that are being extracted from Africa and coming to China.”\nThe sheer size of the latest seizures would suggest that large organised crime networks are masterminding this international trade. “If you are going to transport 13,000kg of scales – it’s really a job that requires a lot of organisation,” says Andersson. “I think there must be massive operations behind it.” Crucially, these criminals are not specialists: in many cases, the same organisations appear to be responsible for trafficking many different species.\nUnfortunately, wildlife trafficking in Hong Kong does not receive the same attention as other forms of organised crime. “There were 89 cases of pangolin smuggling between 2010 and 2015,” Andersson says, “and only nine proceeded with prosecution.” Often the penalties amount to a few months in jail, and a fine of a few thousand Hong Kong dollars. Given the value of the goods being traded – worth tens of millions – those penalties are a risk worth taking. “It’s like a business expense.” Alex Hofford, a wildlife campaigner for the charity WildAid who helped to expose Hong Kong’s illegal ivory trade, agrees that the penalties are “shockingly low”. “[The traffickers] know that if they do get caught, it’ll just be a slap on the wrist.”\nPerhaps pragmatically, the team at HKU are keen to emphasise that they do not see the government as their adversaries. “It’s quite easy to bash the government when it comes to these things, but the people that I’ve encountered are very passionate about it – but they have very little ability to do anything about it, either because they lack the legal mandate or just the funding,\" says David Baker, who specialises in marine ecology, and who has also examined the trading of various sea creatures. \"The number of personnel working on endangered species is quite low.”\nThey hope that by providing the necessary scientific tools, they will help to shape a more effective system. One aim is to demonstrate the existence of large syndicates behind the trading. “When we can really build the evidence to show that it is organised crime, it’ll be taken a lot more seriously,” says Sadovy. They also offer genetic testing to provide further clarity on the species of animals that are being traded, and “isotope analysis”, which can identify chemical traces to pinpoint the animal’s country of origin.\nComputational approaches can also build a more detailed picture of the trade. Cheng and Bonebrake recently \nanalysed the data of recent pangolin seizures\n over the past eight years (amounting to more than 65,000 individual pangolins in total) to better understand the trading networks across China. Their initial analysis, published earlier this year, suggested that there are three particularly crucial hubs for the exchange of these creatures: Guangzhou, Fangchenggang (which borders Vietnam), and Kunming in the Yunnan province, a little farther north.\nFor Bonebrake, this kind of nuanced description is a crucial step forward. “One of the nice things is to break it down… to say that yes, it’s demand from China, but it’s these parts of China, where if we put in more effort, not just for law enforcement, but education and other attempts at demand reduction [of pangolins], we can actually have an impact.”\nAll of the team agree that greater public awareness of these issues is crucial, though they avoid criticising these ancient beliefs too strongly. “You know, I’m not saying that Chinese traditional medicine is wrong or bad or useless,” says Andersson. “The texts are thousands of years old and they have a strong resonance in the culture – but in the instances when mass consumerism on the industrial scale of these endangered species is happening, we need an alternative, because we don’t want them to disappear.”\nHearteningly, opinions are already changing towards some of the trafficked products. Sardovy, for instance, points to the fact that many young people refuse to serve the traditional shark’s fin at their wedding banquets. “To do that they really have to stand up to their parents and the older generation, which is tough,” she says. “It’s an exciting time, I think, to get the right messaging out now.”\nBaker agrees. “At this point in time we have a huge rise – almost a tidal wave – of environmentalism, not just in Hong Kong but also in mainland China. People are more educated and more aware of environmental issues and how their decision-making links to those environmental issues.” The pangolin has even attracted a high-profile ambassador, the Hong Kong actress Sharon Kwok, who is now devoted to educating people about its plight.\nIf that generation acts quickly, there may still be time to save the pangolin.\n数百万年以来，穿山甲天生的铠甲就是它最佳的防御。它是唯一具有坚硬、板状鳞片的哺乳动物，看起来像一只身披锁子甲的獾。只要存在一丁点的危险，穿山甲就会缩成一团，变成一只紧密的球。捕食者几乎不可能弄穿这层硬壳，它甚至可以抵抗狮子、老虎和豹子的牙齿。\n能够亲眼目睹这一行为的科学家并不多。亚洲和非洲分布有八种穿山甲，它们都是夜行动物，并且是出了名的害羞，一天中大部分时间都躲在洞穴和树洞里。即使在自然栖息地工作的环保人士通常也很难发现它们。香港大学生物学家蒂莫西·博尼布雷克（Timothy Bonebrake）说：\"我还没碰到过任何见过野生穿山甲的人。\"\n这种自然的羞怯可能有助于穿山甲躲过细心的环保人士，但它完全不是坚定的偷猎者的对手。猎人通过其独特的足迹——走路时前爪向内弯曲——识别当地的穿山甲数量，然后使用训练有素的狗嗅探穿山甲，找到它们的洞穴，或者等到夜间它们觅食时再捕获它们。博尼布雷克记得在喀麦隆的路边看到偷猎者抓起穿山甲的尾巴来叫卖的情形。\n几十年前，这些动物可能直接在当地市场被售卖。如今，大多数都出口到数千英里外的海外市场。大多数消费者在中国大陆和越南。角质鳞片是传统药物的重要成分，而穿山甲的肉通常被当作宴会上的美味。理想的情况是，厨师把活的穿山甲放在餐桌前，在客人面前切开它的喉咙，以保证肉的新鲜度。而随着亚洲穿山甲数量的减少，非洲有越来越多的穿山甲被捕猎以满足需求。\n国际自然保护联盟（International Union for the Conservation of Nature）估计，在过去十年中，一共有100万只穿山甲跨越国界，使它成为世界上被走私买卖最多的哺乳动物。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    卡拉哈里沙漠（Kalahari Desert）的南非穿山甲——非洲的四种穿山甲之一（图片来源：Alamy）\r\n                \n如果这一情况继续发展下去，灭绝就是不可避免的。穿山甲的自然数量比本世纪初期已经减半，而过去一年的一系列大规模捕捉可能说明需求正在增加。香港大学生态学博士生、国际人道协会（Humane Society International）顾问亚历山德拉·安德森（Alexandra Andersson）说：\"这很难说，但似乎贸易在日益增长。这让人感到难以想象。\"\n这一损失对更广泛的环境的影响在很大程度上是未知的。\"穿山甲的数量正在下降，但这会对生态系统产生影响吗？我们不知道，\"博尼布雷克说，\"但有可能穿山甲真的很重要。\"例如，据信每一只穿山甲每年吃7,000万只蚂蚁和白蚁。\"这对生态系统的循环来说非常重要。\"如果没有这种天然的虫害控制，这些地区可能很快就会出现过多的昆虫。\n然而，与大象、犀牛或老虎面临的危险相比，穿山甲的困境未能渗透到公众意识中，西方尤其如此。博尼布雷克说：\"过去一两年，人们才开始意识到穿山甲遇到麻烦了。正如英国的威廉王子（Prince William）所说的那样，\"穿山甲已经面临濒危风险，而大多数人还未听说过这种动物。\"\n那么，这种很难捕捉的、沉默寡言的生物是如何成为这个上亿美元行业的焦点的呢？我们可以做些什么来拯救它？为了寻找答案，我拜访了香港大学\"保护取证实验室\"的博尼布雷克和安德森。该团体对各种动物走私买卖有独特见解。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    香港上环区常见的现象：整个货架的鲨鱼干——但是很难判断货物是否来自受保护的物种（图片来源：Alamy）\r\n                \n我很快发觉，香港是研究野生动物犯罪的绝佳地点，由于地理、文化、政治和经济原因，香港是贩运许多不同濒危物种的枢纽。在这个更广泛的背景下，才能解释穿山甲面临的日益严峻的威胁。\n我首先在上环区和安德森见面，这里距离香港大学有30分钟的步行路程。一路上，她带我走过卖鱼翅和其他形式的海鲜干货的商店。像穿山甲一样，鱼翅汤常被认为是宴会的核心。美食作家富赫萨·杜洛普（Fuchsia Dunlop）认为，它的质地——带有\"胶状口感\"的\"丝状顺滑\"——可能是吸引人的部分原因；捕猎和杀死鲨鱼的巨额费用也是财富和权力的象征。安德森说：\"皇帝曾经把它当作美味。由于人们想要展现自己的地位，所以鱼翅就变得流行起来。\"\n虽然一些鱼翅在香港是合法的，但是用双髻鲨等物种制作的产品被禁止。不幸的是，目前很难确定一份鱼翅的来源——所以这些商店成为香港非法野生生物贸易最显眼的一面。安德森说：\"如果不能测试每份鱼翅，我不知道你能做什么。\"\n其他商品具有特定的药用价值。除了鱼翅之外，我们还看到悬挂在商店天花板上的干鱼鳔。传统来讲，鱼鳔用于治疗关节疼痛和缓解怀孕中的不适，甚至还有说法是壮阳药。同样的，某些物种的鱼鳔是合法的，而其他一些濒危物种的交易已被禁止——但极高的价格意味着一些贸易商愿意承担风险。一种受到追捧的墨西哥鱼品种石首鱼的利润堪比可卡因。\n\r\n\n\r\n

\n穿山甲的灭绝可能是因为类似的（但在科学上未经证实的）信仰。穿山甲的鳞片由角质素构成，那是与指甲和头发相同的东西，这意味着它应该没有营养价值。但中医认为它可以治愈一些病症。他们认为其益处部分是穿山甲在野外的行为而产生的。博尼布雷克实验室的博士生程文达（Cheng Wenda，音译）说：\"穿山甲鳞片首要的医疗用途是治疗蚂蚁叮咬，因为它们吃蚂蚁。\"而且因为穿山甲会钻孔，所以有人相信它可以打开你身上的淤塞。\"也许正是由于这些原因，一些中医声称穿山甲的鳞片可以提高生育率，甚至可以对抗癌症。\n这些信仰深深植根于文化，香港很多居民依然遵循古老的食谱——正如安德森最近一次调查显示的那样。\"我们发现85％的受访者认为穿山甲鳞片具有药用价值，即使没有同行评议的证据。\"\n<!--\r\ngoogle_ad_client

280;\r\n//-->\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n与鱼翅一样，对于哪些穿山甲可以进口存在一些混淆。直至此前不久，一些非洲种类的穿山甲交易是合法的，但执法者或消费者很难确定其来源。不过在2016年末，新制定的《濒危物种国际贸易公约》（Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species）改变了现状。现在所有种类的穿山甲都受到平等保护。安德森说：\"这是一个巨大的胜利——现在黑白分明了。\"不过她怀疑即使如此，我们经过的几个商店仍可能在交易穿山甲。不过我们必须先努力获得交易者的信任，他们才会坦诚这一点。\n无论如何，大多数进口动物通过香港进到中国其他地区。香港作为\"自由港\"的地位——英国占领的遗产——意味着海关法规传统上比较松散。它的位置使其成为通往需求特别高的广东省的一条简便路径。广东以其野生风味的美食而闻名，其中包括野味——尽管更有争议的原料通常处于保密状态。例如，安德森记得在广州的一家餐馆询问是否可能吃到穿山甲肉。\"他们最初说可以，我们可以帮你安排，\"安德森说——等到服务员回来，她就假装不记得说过这件事。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    2016年12月，中国媒体报道在上海缉获了3吨以上的穿山甲鳞片（图片来源：Getty Images）\r\n                \n过了鱼翅商店后，安德森带我来到她的大学的系里。在这里，她的同事解释了为什么非法动物（包括穿山甲）贸易有增无减。他们说，主要原因可能是中国经济的飞速发展和随之而来的消费主义。致力于保护受威胁的海洋生物的伊冯·萨多维（ Yvonne Sadovy）说：\"无论是药用还是为了显示地位，有各种不同的原因导致更多的人需要更多的东西，而且他们有越来越多的钱可以买到它。\"\n这种经济繁荣通过中国对海外投资的增加成为了国际贸易的支柱。博尼布雷克通过他在喀麦隆的工作证明了这一点，中国投资者正在向当地的基础设施投入资金，回报是在当地获取木材等自然资源的机会。\n他说，两国的文化和经济联系不可忽视。\"我住在喀麦隆雅温得（Yaoundé）的一个地方——在那个区域，有中国酒店、中国餐馆——到处都写着中文。\"他说，\"每当你看到一条新路，你问，'这条路是哪里来的？'是中国人建造的。\"\n所有这些都允许贸易商随着合法进口货物偷运非法货物。\"这些地区之间的贸易太频繁了——如果你在其中一个集装箱里放了一些穿山甲鳞片，并不是很大的问题。\"他补充道，\"缉获的大量穿山甲仅仅是从非洲运往中国的自然资源的一种产物。\"\n最新缉获的庞大数量表明一些有组织的大型犯罪网络正在策划这一国际贸易。安德森说：\"如果你要运送13,000公斤的鳞片，这真的是一个需要周密组织的工作。我认为这背后必定有大量的运作。\"关键是这些罪犯不是专家：在很多情况下，同样的组织似乎负责贩运许多不同的物种。\n不幸的是，香港的野生动物走私并不像其他形式的有组织犯罪一样受到重视。\"在2010年至2015年期间，有89起穿山甲走私案件，只有9起案件被起诉\"，安德森说。处罚通常最多是监禁数月，罚款数千港币。考虑到交易货物的价值——价值数千万——这是值得冒惩罚的风险。\"这就像是成本一样，\"埃里克斯·霍福德（Alex Hofford）说到，他是支持\"野生救援\"组织（WildAid）的野生动物活动家。野生救援组织是曝光香港非法象牙贸易的慈善机构。他认为惩罚力度\"小的惊人\"。\"[走私者]知道，如果他们被抓住了，惩罚最多也就是小打小闹。\"\n\r\n\n\r\n                    从北苏门答腊的走私分子那里救出的小穿山甲（图片来源：Getty Images）\r\n                \n从实用主义角度，香港大学的团队也强调，政府并不是敌人。\"在这些方面，批评政府很容易。但是，我遇到过很有热情的人，不过他们对这方面无能为力，因为他们缺乏合法的授权或缺乏资金，\"专门从事海洋生态学的大卫·贝克（David Baker）说：\"在濒危物种领域工作的人很少。\"他也研究了各种海洋生物的贸易情况。\n他们希望通过提供必要的科学工具，帮助建立更有效的制度。一个目的是揭露交易背后的大集团的存在。萨多维说：\"当我们真正建立证据来证明这是有组织的犯罪行为时，它会受到更多的重视。\"他们还提供基因测试，以进一步澄清正在交易的动物种类，还有\"同位素分析\"，这可以用来识别化学踪迹，以确定动物的原产地。\n计算方法还可以建立更详细的贸易图。 程文达和博尼布雷克最近分析了过去八年间最近发生的穿山甲缉获量的数据（总共超过65,000只穿山甲），以更好地了解中国的贸易网络。他们今年早些时候发表的初步分析表明，有三个特别重要的交易枢纽：广州，防城港（临近越南边界），靠北一点的云南昆明。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    环保人士试图在香港街头提高人们对穿山甲所遇困境的认识（图片来源：Alexandra Andersson）\r\n                \n对于博尼布雷克来说，这种微妙的描述是向前迈出的关键一步。\"其中一个优点是把它分解开来……对，这是中国的需求，但这是在中国的这些地方，如果我们加大力度，不仅要执法，还要通过教育和其他方法来减少对穿山甲的需求。我们其实可以发挥作用。\"\n整个团队都同意，提高公众对这些问题的认识是至关重要的，尽管他们避免太激烈的批评这些古老的信仰。安德森说：\"你知道，我不是说中药是错误的，是不好的，没用处。这些文本流传了数千年，对文化有着强烈的共鸣。但是当大众消费主义围绕这些濒危动物形成行业时，我们需要一种替代品，因为我们不希望它们消失。\"\n令人鼓舞的是，对一些被贩运的产品的看法已经开始变化。例如，萨多维指出，许多年轻人在婚宴上拒绝提供传统的鱼翅。她说：\"要做到这一点，他们确实不得不反对他们的父母和老一辈的看法，这很不容易。我想，这是一个令人兴奋的时刻，正确的信息正在传播出去。\"\n贝克也表示同意：\"在这个时候，不仅是在香港而且在中国大陆，环保主义正在崛起——简直像是一波涨潮。人们的教育水平提高了，他们更多的意识到环境问题和他们的决策与这些环境问题之间的联系。\"穿山甲甚至吸引了一位重要人物的注意，香港女演员郭秀云现在正致力于教育人们穿山甲遇到的困境。\n如果我们这一代人快速行动起来，我们可能还有时间拯救穿山甲。\n\r\n\r\r\n \nMany people in the West have never even heard of the pangolin, yet this “scaly anteater” is the source of a billion-dollar criminal industry that threatens to push it to extinction. BBC Future met a team of Hong Kong’s ecologists and activists trying to save these creatures from extinction.\n\r\n\nFor millions of years, the pangolin’s natural reserve had been its best defence. The only mammal with hard, plate-like scales, it looks something like a badger in chainmail – and at the merest hint of danger, the pangolin simply roles up into a tight ball that is nearly impossible for a predator to penetrate.

The rising threat facing the pangolin only makes sense in this broader context.\nI first meet Andersson in the Sheung Wan district, a 30-minute walk from the university. Along the way, she leads me past shop after shop selling shark’s fin and other forms of dried seafood. Like pangolin meat, the shark’s fin soup is often considered the centrepiece of a banquet. Its texture – a kind of “strandy silkiness” with a “gelatinous bite”, according to food writer Fuchsia Dunlop – may be part of the attraction; but so is the sheer expense of hunting and killing the shark, making it a symbol of wealth and power. “Emperors used to eat it as a delicacy, and it’s become popular because people want to demonstrate their status,” says Andersson.\nAlthough some shark’s fins are legal in Hong Kong, products from species such as the hammerhead are banned.

Alongside the shark fins we see dried fish bladders – or “maws” – hanging from the shop ceilings. The maws are traditionally used to cure joint pains and ease the discomfort of pregnancy and are even said to be aphrodisiacs. Again, certain species’ maws are legal, while the trade of other endangered species has been banned – but the stratospheric prices mean some traders are willing to take the risk. The trade of one particularly sought-after species of Mexican fish, the totoaba, is apparently as lucrative as cocaine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\n\nThe pangolin’s extinction may arise from similar (scientifically unproven) beliefs. The animal’s scales are simply made from keratin, the same stuff as fingernails and hair, meaning they should have little nutritional value, but practitioners of Chinese medicine believe that they can cure a number of ills. The benefits are thought to arise, in part, from their behaviour in the wild. “The first medical use of pangolin scales was to treat ant stings – because they eat ants,” says Cheng Wenda, a PhD student in Bonebrake’s lab. “And because pangolins dig holes, they believe they can open some blockage in your body.” Perhaps for these reasons, some practitioners claim the scales can improve fertility and that they can even fight cancer.\nThese beliefs are deeply embedded in the culture, and many residents in Hong Kong continue to follow the ancient recipes – as Andersson showed with a recent survey. “We found that 85% of the respondents thought that pangolin scales had medicinal value, even though there is no peer-reviewed evidence for this.”\nAs with the shark fins, there had been some confusion about which pangolin species could be imported: until recently, it was legal to trade certain quantities ofthe African species, but it was very hard for law enforcers or consumers to verify the source. That changed with a new ruling of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species in late 2016, which now protects all species equally. “That was a very big win – now it’s as clear as day, black and white,” says Andersson. Even so, she suspects that a few of the shops we pass may be trading in the scales, although we would have to work hard to gain their trust before the traders would admit it openly.\nIn any case, most of the imported animals pass through Hong Kong to the rest of China. Its status as a ‘free port’ – a legacy of British occupation – has meant that customs regulations are traditionally lax, and its location makes it an easy route to the nearby Guangdong province, where demand is particularly high. The region is famed for its ‘wild flavour’ cuisine, including the use of bush meats – although the use of more controversial ingredients is often sheathed in secrecy. Andersson, for instance, remembers enquiring about the possibility of eating pangolin meat at a restaurant in Guangzhou. “They initially said yeah, we can organise that for you,” Andersson says – only for the waiter to return, pretending that he had no recollection of the conversation.\n\r\n\nAfter our walk through the shark fin shops, Andersson takes me to her university department, where her colleagues help to explain why the illegal trade of animals – including pangolins – continues unabated. The primary explanation may be the rocketing Chinese economy, and the resulting consumerism, they say. “Whether it’s for medicinal use, or status – there are different reasons depending on what it is – more people want more stuff, and they’ve got more money to be able to buy it,” says Yvonne Sadovy, who is working on the conservation of threatened marine life.\nThis economic boom has also created a backbone of international trading links through China’s increasing investments abroad. Bonebrake witnessed this through his work in Cameroon, where Chinese investors are pouring money into the local infrastructure, in return for increased access to natural resources, like the local timber.\nThe cultural and economic connections between the two countries are impossible to ignore, he says. “Where I stay in Yaoundé in Cameroon – in that part of town, there are Chinese hotels, Chinese restaurants – all the writing’s in Chinese,” he says. “And every time you see a new road, you say, ‘where did this come from?’ And it’s the Chinese that built it.”\nAll of which allows the traders to slip in their illegal goods along with the legitimate imports. “There’s so much back and forth between these areas – it’s actually not such a big deal if you have some pangolin scales in one of the shipping containers,” he adds. “A lot of these huge pangolin seizures are just a consequence of the natural resources that are being extracted from Africa and coming to China.”\nThe sheer size of the latest seizures would suggest that large organised crime networks are masterminding this international trade. “If you are going to transport 13,000kg of scales – it’s really a job that requires a lot of organisation,” says Andersson. “I think there must be massive operations behind it.” Crucially, these criminals are not specialists: in many cases, the same organisations appear to be responsible for trafficking many different species.\nUnfortunately, wildlife trafficking in Hong Kong does not receive the same attention as other forms of organised crime. “There were 89 cases of pangolin smuggling between 2010 and 2015,” Andersson says, “and only nine proceeded with prosecution.” Often the penalties amount to a few months in jail, and a fine of a few thousand Hong Kong dollars. Given the value of the goods being traded – worth tens of millions – those penalties are a risk worth taking. “It’s like a business expense.” Alex Hofford, a wildlife campaigner for the charity WildAid who helped to expose Hong Kong’s illegal ivory trade, agrees that the penalties are “shockingly low”. “[The traffickers] know that if they do get caught, it’ll just be a slap on the wrist.”\n\r\n\nPerhaps pragmatically, the team at HKU are keen to emphasise that they do not see the government as their adversaries. “It’s quite easy to bash the government when it comes to these things, but the people that I’ve encountered are very passionate about it – but they have very little ability to do anything about it, either because they lack the legal mandate or just the funding,\" says David Baker, who specialises in marine ecology, and who has also examined the trading of various sea creatures. \"The number of personnel working on endangered species is quite low.”\nThey hope that by providing the necessary scientific tools, they will help to shape a more effective system. One aim is to demonstrate the existence of large syndicates behind the trading. “When we can really build the evidence to show that it is organised crime, it’ll be taken a lot more seriously,” says Sadovy. They also offer genetic testing to provide further clarity on the species of animals that are being traded, and “isotope analysis”, which can identify chemical traces to pinpoint the animal’s country of origin.\nComputational approaches can also build a more detailed picture of the trade. Cheng and Bonebrake recently \nanalysed the data of recent pangolin seizures\n over the past eight years (amounting to more than 65,000 individual pangolins in total) to better understand the trading networks across China. Their initial analysis, published earlier this year, suggested that there are three particularly crucial hubs for the exchange of these creatures: Guangzhou, Fangchenggang (which borders Vietnam), and Kunming in the Yunnan province, a little farther north.\n\r\n\nFor Bonebrake, this kind of nuanced description is a crucial step forward. “One of the nice things is to break it down… to say that yes, it’s demand from China, but it’s these parts of China, where if we put in more effort, not just for law enforcement, but education and other attempts at demand reduction [of pangolins], we can actually have an impact.”\nAll of the team agree that greater public awareness of these issues is crucial, though they avoid criticising these ancient beliefs too strongly. “You know, I’m not saying that Chinese traditional medicine is wrong or bad or useless,” says Andersson. “The texts are thousands of years old and they have a strong resonance in the culture – but in the instances when mass consumerism on the industrial scale of these endangered species is happening, we need an alternative, because we don’t want them to disappear.”\nHearteningly, opinions are already changing towards some of the trafficked products. Sardovy, for instance, points to the fact that many young people refuse to serve the traditional shark’s fin at their wedding banquets. “To do that they really have to stand up to their parents and the older generation, which is tough,” she says. “It’s an exciting time, I think, to get the right messaging out now.”\nBaker agrees. “At this point in time we have a huge rise – almost a tidal wave – of environmentalism, not just in Hong Kong but also in mainland China. People are more educated and more aware of environmental issues and how their decision-making links to those environmental issues.” The pangolin has even attracted a high-profile ambassador, the Hong Kong actress Sharon Kwok, who is now devoted to educating people about its plight.\nIf that generation acts quickly, there may still be time to save the pangolin.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n

Bonebrake）说：\"我还没碰到过任何见过野生穿山甲的人。\"\n这种自然的羞怯可能有助于穿山甲躲过细心的环保人士，但它完全不是坚定的偷猎者的对手。猎人通过其独特的足迹——走路时前爪向内弯曲——识别当地的穿山甲数量，然后使用训练有素的狗嗅探穿山甲，找到它们的洞穴，或者等到夜间它们觅食时再捕获它们。博尼布雷克记得在喀麦隆的路边看到偷猎者抓起穿山甲的尾巴来叫卖的情形。\n\r\n\n几十年前，这些动物可能直接在当地市场被售卖。如今，大多数都出口到数千英里外的海外市场。大多数消费者在中国大陆和越南。角质鳞片是传统药物的重要成分，而穿山甲的肉通常被当作宴会上的美味。理想的情况是，厨师把活的穿山甲放在餐桌前，在客人面前切开它的喉咙，以保证肉的新鲜度。而随着亚洲穿山甲数量的减少，非洲有越来越多的穿山甲被捕猎以满足需求。\n国际自然保护联盟（International Union for the Conservation of Nature）估计，在过去十年中，一共有100万只穿山甲跨越国界，使它成为世界上被走私买卖最多的哺乳动物。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    卡拉哈里沙漠（Kalahari Desert）的南非穿山甲——非洲的四种穿山甲之一（图片来源：Alamy）\r\n                \n如果这一情况继续发展下去，灭绝就是不可避免的。穿山甲的自然数量比本世纪初期已经减半，而过去一年的一系列大规模捕捉可能说明需求正在增加。香港大学生态学博士生、国际人道协会（Humane Society International）顾问亚历山德拉·安德森（Alexandra Andersson）说：\"这很难说，但似乎贸易在日益增长。这让人感到难以想象。\"\n这一损失对更广泛的环境的影响在很大程度上是未知的。\"穿山甲的数量正在下降，但这会对生态系统产生影响吗？我们不知道，\"博尼布雷克说，\"但有可能穿山甲真的很重要。\"例如，据信每一只穿山甲每年吃7,000万只蚂蚁和白蚁。\"这对生态系统的循环来说非常重要。\"如果没有这种天然的虫害控制，这些地区可能很快就会出现过多的昆虫。\n然而，与大象、犀牛或老虎面临的危险相比，穿山甲的困境未能渗透到公众意识中，西方尤其如此。博尼布雷克说：\"过去一两年，人们才开始意识到穿山甲遇到麻烦了。正如英国的威廉王子（Prince William）所说的那样，\"穿山甲已经面临濒危风险，而大多数人还未听说过这种动物。\"\n那么，这种很难捕捉的、沉默寡言的生物是如何成为这个上亿美元行业的焦点的呢？我们可以做些什么来拯救它？为了寻找答案，我拜访了香港大学\"保护取证实验室\"的博尼布雷克和安德森。该团体对各种动物走私买卖有独特见解。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    香港上环区常见的现象：整个货架的鲨鱼干——但是很难判断货物是否来自受保护的物种（图片来源：Alamy）\r\n                \n我很快发觉，香港是研究野生动物犯罪的绝佳地点，由于地理、文化、政治和经济原因，香港是贩运许多不同濒危物种的枢纽。在这个更广泛的背景下，才能解释穿山甲面临的日益严峻的威胁。\n我首先在上环区和安德森见面，这里距离香港大学有30分钟的步行路程。一路上，她带我走过卖鱼翅和其他形式的海鲜干货的商店。像穿山甲一样，鱼翅汤常被认为是宴会的核心。美食作家富赫萨·杜洛普（Fuchsia Dunlop）认为，它的质地——带有\"胶状口感\"的\"丝状顺滑\"——可能是吸引人的部分原因；捕猎和杀死鲨鱼的巨额费用也是财富和权力的象征。安德森说：\"皇帝曾经把它当作美味。由于人们想要展现自己的地位，所以鱼翅就变得流行起来。\"\n虽然一些鱼翅在香港是合法的，但是用双髻鲨等物种制作的产品被禁止。不幸的是，目前很难确定一份鱼翅的来源——所以这些商店成为香港非法野生生物贸易最显眼的一面。安德森说：\"如果不能测试每份鱼翅，我不知道你能做什么。\"\n其他商品具有特定的药用价值。除了鱼翅之外，我们还看到悬挂在商店天花板上的干鱼鳔。传统来讲，鱼鳔用于治疗关节疼痛和缓解怀孕中的不适，甚至还有说法是壮阳药。同样的，某些物种的鱼鳔是合法的，而其他一些濒危物种的交易已被禁止——但极高的价格意味着一些贸易商愿意承担风险。一种受到追捧的墨西哥鱼品种石首鱼的利润堪比可卡因。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n

\n穿山甲的灭绝可能是因为类似的（但在科学上未经证实的）信仰。穿山甲的鳞片由角质素构成，那是与指甲和头发相同的东西，这意味着它应该没有营养价值。但中医认为它可以治愈一些病症。他们认为其益处部分是穿山甲在野外的行为而产生的。博尼布雷克实验室的博士生程文达（Cheng Wenda，音译）说：\"穿山甲鳞片首要的医疗用途是治疗蚂蚁叮咬，因为它们吃蚂蚁。\"而且因为穿山甲会钻孔，所以有人相信它可以打开你身上的淤塞。\"也许正是由于这些原因，一些中医声称穿山甲的鳞片可以提高生育率，甚至可以对抗癌症。\n这些信仰深深植根于文化，香港很多居民依然遵循古老的食谱——正如安德森最近一次调查显示的那样。\"我们发现85％的受访者认为穿山甲鳞片具有药用价值，即使没有同行评议的证据。\"\n\r\n\n<!--\r\ngoogle_ad_client

Species）改变了现状。现在所有种类的穿山甲都受到平等保护。安德森说：\"这是一个巨大的胜利——现在黑白分明了。\"不过她怀疑即使如此，我们经过的几个商店仍可能在交易穿山甲。不过我们必须先努力获得交易者的信任，他们才会坦诚这一点。\n无论如何，大多数进口动物通过香港进到中国其他地区。香港作为\"自由港\"的地位——英国占领的遗产——意味着海关法规传统上比较松散。它的位置使其成为通往需求特别高的广东省的一条简便路径。广东以其野生风味的美食而闻名，其中包括野味——尽管更有争议的原料通常处于保密状态。例如，安德森记得在广州的一家餐馆询问是否可能吃到穿山甲肉。\"他们最初说可以，我们可以帮你安排，\"安德森说——等到服务员回来，她就假装不记得说过这件事。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    2016年12月，中国媒体报道在上海缉获了3吨以上的穿山甲鳞片（图片来源：Getty Images）\r\n                \n过了鱼翅商店后，安德森带我来到她的大学的系里。在这里，她的同事解释了为什么非法动物（包括穿山甲）贸易有增无减。他们说，主要原因可能是中国经济的飞速发展和随之而来的消费主义。致力于保护受威胁的海洋生物的伊冯·萨多维（ Yvonne Sadovy）说：\"无论是药用还是为了显示地位，有各种不同的原因导致更多的人需要更多的东西，而且他们有越来越多的钱可以买到它。\"\n这种经济繁荣通过中国对海外投资的增加成为了国际贸易的支柱。博尼布雷克通过他在喀麦隆的工作证明了这一点，中国投资者正在向当地的基础设施投入资金，回报是在当地获取木材等自然资源的机会。\n他说，两国的文化和经济联系不可忽视。\"我住在喀麦隆雅温得（Yaoundé）的一个地方——在那个区域，有中国酒店、中国餐馆——到处都写着中文。\"他说，\"每当你看到一条新路，你问，'这条路是哪里来的？'是中国人建造的。\"\n所有这些都允许贸易商随着合法进口货物偷运非法货物。\"这些地区之间的贸易太频繁了——如果你在其中一个集装箱里放了一些穿山甲鳞片，并不是很大的问题。\"他补充道，\"缉获的大量穿山甲仅仅是从非洲运往中国的自然资源的一种产物。\"\n最新缉获的庞大数量表明一些有组织的大型犯罪网络正在策划这一国际贸易。安德森说：\"如果你要运送13,000公斤的鳞片，这真的是一个需要周密组织的工作。我认为这背后必定有大量的运作。\"关键是这些罪犯不是专家：在很多情况下，同样的组织似乎负责贩运许多不同的物种。\n不幸的是，香港的野生动物走私并不像其他形式的有组织犯罪一样受到重视。\"在2010年至2015年期间，有89起穿山甲走私案件，只有9起案件被起诉\"，安德森说。处罚通常最多是监禁数月，罚款数千港币。考虑到交易货物的价值——价值数千万——这是值得冒惩罚的风险。\"这就像是成本一样，\"埃里克斯·霍福德（Alex Hofford）说到，他是支持\"野生救援\"组织（WildAid）的野生动物活动家。野生救援组织是曝光香港非法象牙贸易的慈善机构。他认为惩罚力度\"小的惊人\"。\"[走私者]知道，如果他们被抓住了，惩罚最多也就是小打小闹。\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    从北苏门答腊的走私分子那里救出的小穿山甲（图片来源：Getty Images）\r\n                \n从实用主义角度，香港大学的团队也强调，政府并不是敌人。\"在这些方面，批评政府很容易。但是，我遇到过很有热情的人，不过他们对这方面无能为力，因为他们缺乏合法的授权或缺乏资金，\"专门从事海洋生态学的大卫·贝克（David Baker）说：\"在濒危物种领域工作的人很少。\"他也研究了各种海洋生物的贸易情况。\n他们希望通过提供必要的科学工具，帮助建立更有效的制度。一个目的是揭露交易背后的大集团的存在。萨多维说：\"当我们真正建立证据来证明这是有组织的犯罪行为时，它会受到更多的重视。\"他们还提供基因测试，以进一步澄清正在交易的动物种类，还有\"同位素分析\"，这可以用来识别化学踪迹，以确定动物的原产地。\n计算方法还可以建立更详细的贸易图。 程文达和博尼布雷克最近分析了过去八年间最近发生的穿山甲缉获量的数据（总共超过65,000只穿山甲），以更好地了解中国的贸易网络。他们今年早些时候发表的初步分析表明，有三个特别重要的交易枢纽：广州，防城港（临近越南边界），靠北一点的云南昆明。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    环保人士试图在香港街头提高人们对穿山甲所遇困境的认识（图片来源：Alexandra Andersson）\r\n                \n对于博尼布雷克来说，这种微妙的描述是向前迈出的关键一步。\"其中一个优点是把它分解开来……对，这是中国的需求，但这是在中国的这些地方，如果我们加大力度，不仅要执法，还要通过教育和其他方法来减少对穿山甲的需求。我们其实可以发挥作用。\"\n整个团队都同意，提高公众对这些问题的认识是至关重要的，尽管他们避免太激烈的批评这些古老的信仰。安德森说：\"你知道，我不是说中药是错误的，是不好的，没用处。这些文本流传了数千年，对文化有着强烈的共鸣。但是当大众消费主义围绕这些濒危动物形成行业时，我们需要一种替代品，因为我们不希望它们消失。\"\n令人鼓舞的是，对一些被贩运的产品的看法已经开始变化。例如，萨多维指出，许多年轻人在婚宴上拒绝提供传统的鱼翅。她说：\"要做到这一点，他们确实不得不反对他们的父母和老一辈的看法，这很不容易。我想，这是一个令人兴奋的时刻，正确的信息正在传播出去。\"\n贝克也表示同意：\"在这个时候，不仅是在香港而且在中国大陆，环保主义正在崛起——简直像是一波涨潮。人们的教育水平提高了，他们更多的意识到环境问题和他们的决策与这些环境问题之间的联系。\"穿山甲甚至吸引了一位重要人物的注意，香港女演员郭秀云现在正致力于教育人们穿山甲遇到的困境。\n如果我们这一代人快速行动起来，我们可能还有时间拯救穿山甲。\n\r\n"
