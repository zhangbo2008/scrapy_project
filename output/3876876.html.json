In March, they announced their breakup, but that hasn't stopped them from being together.\nWe’re no longer a couple ― but I still want to be with you!\nSly celebrities determined to show the world that their breakup was amicable and that there’s no dirt to dig up have been making sure to be photographed looking weirdly affectionate and happy post-split.\nGwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin ― who announced on March 25 that they would “consciously uncouple” ― were spotted days later vacationing together in the Bahamas\nThey’re not the only ones. Kris and Bruce Jenner held hands at an L.A. airport Wednesday as they returned from a family vacation in Thailand, nearly six months after announcing their separation.\nAnd despite their split, Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr have been seen out and about in Manhattan with their young son, Flynn, with Kerr hanging onto Bloom’s arm and smiling.\nWhy all this lovey-dovey behavior from people who no longer want to be together?\nPart of it is to put on a front that there’s nothing worth watching, according Brian Balthazar, editor of the culture website POP Goes the Week.\n“Whenever a celebrity couple splits, if they can agree on one thing, it’s that the press is going to be watching them to see what they do,” he says.\nIt’s definitely “image management,” agrees Tom Fitzgerald, one half of the celebrity blog Tom & Lorenzo and co-author of “Everybody Wants to Be Me or Do Me.” “Celebrities leverage their personal lives for public sympathy constantly.”\nFitzgerald believes that the reasons behind these kooky displays of love between exes vary.\n“With the Jenners, every single thing they do is for the public eye and to keep their story lines going,” Fitzgerald says of the reality TV show family that appears on E!’s “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” “I wouldn’t call that a public expression of anything.”\nAnd Goop girl Paltrow on a breakup-moon?\n“With Gwyneth, I see a very masterful plan in manipulating her own image in this ‘consciously uncoupled’ period they’re going through,” Fitzgerald says. “There have been so many rumors about their marriage for years, and she’s definitely trying to minimize the stuff about them for the next couple months.”\nThen there’s the fact that Paltrow doesn’t see herself as “just like us” ― and she doesn’t want you to, either.\n“So much of what we see in celeb culture today is about making celebs seem ordinary,” says Andrea McDonnell, author of forthcoming book “Reading Celebrity Gossip Magazines.”\n“She’s a star who has built her brand on seeming different than ordinary people,” McDonnell adds. “Her split with Chris seemed to be very much about trying to retain that image of extraordinariness ― like, ‘Even in the hardest times, I’m still going to be OK and still going to maintain an idealized performance of self. I’m still going to have my vegan lunch.’ ”\nThere’s also the kids. (Paltrow and Martin have two together.)\n“(Celebrities) want them to think their lives aren’t going to change so much, and that everything’s going to be OK,” Balthazar says.\nKerr and Bloom’s post-split affection might be more genuine than the rest, Fitzgerald notes.\n“(They) always came across as this sweetly affectionate couple, and it almost felt genuine, especially since neither one of them has been very good about coming up with a story line about who they are,” he says.\nAnd with a young child, Fitzgerald adds, maybe they’re simply trying to make it work.\nBut sending mixed messages to kids and fans ― like hand-holding and snuggling after declaring you’re no longer a couple ― isn’t the best idea either.\n“It seems like an oxymoron for a couple that is splitting up to do that in public,” says Balthazar.\n 查看译文\n奥斯卡得主格温妮丝・帕特洛（Gwyneth Paltrow）和英国“酷玩”乐团主唱克里斯・马丁（Chris Martin）今年一月时仍情意绵绵。三月份，他们宣布分手，却依然相伴彼此左右。\n“我们已经不是夫妻了，但还是想在一块！”\n这对明星夫妻决心向世界证明他们系和平分手，没有什么所谓的内幕。上图摄于两人宣布分手后，可以看出二人看上去仍然亲密无间，这实在不太寻常。\n格温妮丝・帕特洛和克里斯・马丁3月25日宣布两人分手既定，但几天后他们在巴哈马度假的照片被媒体曝光。\n他们并不是分手后仍在一起的明星夫妇。4月3日，女星克丽丝・詹纳（Kris ）与奥运会冠军布鲁斯・詹纳（Bruce Jenner）结束泰国家庭度假返回洛杉矶机场，被目睹牵手同行，而近半年前两人已宣布分手。\n同样，好莱坞影星奥兰多・布鲁姆（Orlando Bloom）与超模妻子米兰达・可儿（Miranda Kerr）虽然已经离婚，却常常被媒体拍到在曼哈顿与他们的儿子弗里恩（Flynn）一同出行，可儿手挽布鲁姆，面露微笑。\n既然夫妻已经分道扬镳，为何还有如此亲密之举？\n明星夫妻分手后依旧共同露面的一个原因是为了表示他们没有什么值得媒体关注的，潮流文化网站《一周潮流》（POP Goes the Week）编辑布莱恩・巴萨扎（ Brian Balthazar）说道。\n“每次明星分手时，他们都能意见统一的一件事就是媒体还会密切注视他们的行动。”他说道。\n《人人都想成为我》合著者、“汤姆&洛伦佐”博客的汤姆・费茨杰拉德对此也表示赞同。“名人常常用自己的私生活来博取大众同情。”\n费茨杰拉德认为这些后离婚时代甜蜜怪像背后的原因有所不同。\n“詹钠夫妇秀恩爱是为了抓住公众眼球”，菲兹杰拉德说道。这一家人都参与《与卡戴珊姐妹同行》的拍摄。“所以我认为他们露面并没有什么实质意义。”\n但“小辣椒”帕特洛和马丁又是怎么一回事？\n“格温妮丝很好地利用这段'分手期'来塑造自己的形象“，菲兹杰拉德说道，”多年来二人婚变传闻不断，她必定在接下来几个月努力淡化此事。“”\n事实上，帕特洛认为自己“不同于常人”――她也不希望大众把自己当成普通人看。\n“现在的名人文化潮流是将名人普通化。”，即将上市的新书――《为何我们爱看八卦杂志》（“Reading Celebrity Gossip Magazines”）作者安德莉亚・麦克唐奈（ Andrea McDonnell）如是说。\n“格温妮丝的个人亮点就是与大众不同”，麦克唐奈补充道，“她和克里斯的分手也像是在保持自己的特立独行――‘即便在最难过的时候，我也会过得很好，继续保持我完美的形象。我还是会坚持我的素食主义。’ ”\n当然，明星夫妇也考虑到孩子的因素。（帕特洛和马丁育有两个孩子。）\n“（明星）希望让孩子感到生活不会有太大改变，一切都将照常。”巴萨扎说。\n费兹杰拉德提到，可儿和布鲁姆的后离婚时代感情可能比其他几对明星更真实。\n他还提到，“可儿和布鲁姆一贯给大众留下甜蜜情侣的印象，这种印象感觉近乎真实，尤其二人都不是特别擅长刻意塑造形象，”\n加上孩子尚且年幼，也许他们真的只是在努力处理分手后的关系。\n但给孩子和粉丝留下矛盾的印象――例如宣布分手后依然牵手相拥――也不是的方法。\n“明星夫妻分手后依然在公众面前秀恩爱看起来自相矛盾，”巴萨扎说。"
