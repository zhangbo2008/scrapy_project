The train seemed to show no indication of slowing down before the bend.\r\n\n这段视频似乎显示，在本应向右转之前，火车头径直脱离轨道，开始向左侧翻转。火车在转弯前似乎没有减速的迹象。\r\n\nAll eight of the train’s cars derailed, some knocking over concrete pylons. By Monday morning the wreckage had been cleared from the tracks.\r\n\n列车的八节车厢全部脱轨，一些车厢撞翻了混凝土塔。截至周一上午，列车残骸已从轨道上清除。\r\n\nLai Sui-chin, deputy director of the railway agency’s rolling stock department, said the conductor had noted abnormally low pressure from the air compressor that controls the power system.\r\n\n台湾铁路局机务处副处长赖隨金表示，列车司机已经注意到控制动力系统的风泵出现异常低压。\r\n\n“The driver reported the problem many times as the train traveled between Toucheng and Jiaoxi stations,” Mr. Lai said, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n台湾中央通讯社援引他的话说：“当火车在头城和礁溪站之间运行时，司机多次报告此问题。”\r\n\nTechnicians serviced the train when it stopped at Yilan Station before the accident, he said, after which the driver made no additional complaints about the power system.\r\n\n他说，事故发生前，技术人员在列车停靠宜兰站时对其进行了维修，之后司机没有对动力系统提出其他抱怨。\r\n\nLu Chieh-shen, director of the railway agency, said it was unlikely that an air compressor problem could have caused the train to accelerate, but that it was possible the automatic train protection system had been manually disabled. The system continuously compares train speed with signaling to ensure safe speeds are maintained.\r\n\n铁路局局长鹿洁身表示，风泵问题不太可能导致列车加速，但可能列车自动防护系统已被手动禁用。该系统能连续地比较列车速度与地面设备传送的信号，以确保列车保持安全的速度。\r\n\nInvestigators met midday Monday with the conductor, who was among the injured and had been hospitalized overnight. Mr. Lu said the conductor had five years of experience on the job.\r\n\n调查人员周一中午与这名司机见了面。司机受了伤，目前仍在医院接受治疗。鹿洁身说这名司机有五年的工作经验。\r\n\nTaiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, and its premier, Lai Ching-te, both visited Yilan County after the accident.\r\n\n事故发生后，台湾总统蔡英文和行政院长赖清德都来到了宜兰县的事故现场。\r\n\nMs. Tsai visited one of the four local hospitals treating victims. She met with family members of the deceased, offering condolences, and prayed with Buddhist monks at a local temple.\r\n\n蔡英文去了为伤者提供治疗的当地四家医院之一。她看望了死者的家属，向他们表示哀悼，并在当地一座寺庙与佛教僧侣一起做了祈祷。\r\n\nThe eight family members who died after attending the wedding ranged in age from 9 to 67, Tung Xiao-ling, 43, a relative of the victims who was not on the train, told Reuters. The victims were attending the wedding of Ms. Tung’s sister.\r\n\n遇难者亲属、43岁的董小羚告诉路透社，参加婚礼后在返程路上遇难的一家八口，年龄最小的9岁、最大的67岁。董小羚本人不在那趟火车上。这家人是去参加董小羚妹妹的婚礼的。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nOne American was among the injured.\r\n\n伤者中包括一名美国人。\r\n\nThe train accident is the deadliest in Taiwan since 1981, when a collision in Miaoli County, in the island’s northwest, killed 31 people.\r\n\n这次火车事故是1981年以来台湾最致命的一次。1981年，台湾西北部苗栗县发生过一起两列火车相撞的事故，造成31人死亡。\r\n\nThe Central News Agency reported that passengers on the train that crashed Sunday said the emergency brakes had been applied multiple times before the derailing, and that illuminated signs on the train had been operating in an abnormal manner.\r\n\n台湾中央通讯社报道称，乘客表示，列车在脱轨之前曾多次试图紧急刹车，车上的照明标志也一直不正常。\r\n\nMr. Lai, the premier, told local reporters that if the investigation turned up evidence of a problem with the train cars, he would look into suspending services by the Puyuma Express, which is the fastest train line serving Taiwan’s east coast. It has been in service since 2013.\r\n\n赖清德对当地记者说，如果调查发现证据表明列车车厢出了问题的话，他会考虑暂停普悠玛列车的运行。普悠玛是服务于台湾东海岸的速度最快的干线列车，于2013年投入使用。\r\n\n翻译：Cindy Hao\r\n"
