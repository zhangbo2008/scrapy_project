Now, they are jittery, pressing sell at even small signs of trouble.\r\n\n直到前不久，投资者还对地缘政治事件、经济风险和其他给美国公司的前景蒙上阴影的问题视而不见。现在，他们变得紧张不安，甚至在麻烦出现小征兆时就急着出售。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nStrong growth and deep corporate tax cuts have supercharged corporate profits this year. Once all the results are tallied up, the third-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up more than 28 percent from a year earlier — outpacing previous quarters.\r\n\n强劲的增长和大幅企业减税措施使今年的企业利润增加。一旦所有结果统计出来，标准普尔500指数成份股公司第三季度的收益预计将比去年同期增长28%以上——超过前几个季度。\r\n\nBut those numbers haven’t satisfied investors, who have grown simultaneously concerned about risks they face if the economy stays strong — such as rising interest rates and increased expenses for wages — as well as the threat to stocks from a significant global slowdown.\r\n\n但这些数字并未令投资者满意，他们同时还关注经济保持强势所面临的风险——例如利率上升和工资支出增加——以及全球经济放缓对股市的威胁。 \r\n\nOn Tuesday, shares of the retailer Target dropped by more than 10 percent, on worries that rising costs — from increased wages to higher prices for the Chinese goods facing tariffs — could continue to crimp profits. Investors also dumped shares of Kohl’s and TJX, the owner of T.J. Maxx, which both saw freight costs eat into earnings.\r\n\n周二，零售商塔吉特(Target)的股价下跌超过10%，原因是担心成本上升——从工资上涨到面临关税的中国商品价格上涨——可能继续压低利润。投资者还抛售了柯尔(Kohl’s)和T.J. Maxx公司的所有者TJX的股票，两家公司都面临运费成本侵蚀利润。\r\n\nApple continued its slide on worries about softening demand. The tech giant tumbled nearly 5 percent, after Goldman Sachs equity analysts cut their price target citing deteriorating demand, especially in China.\r\n\n由于担心需求疲软，苹果股价继续下滑。在高盛(Goldman Sachs)股票分析师因需求恶化（尤其是在中国）下调其价格目标后，这家科技股大跌近5%。\r\n\nChina, the world’s largest consumer of oil, has also been weighing on commodities. Oil prices, now just above $53 a barrel, have fallen more than 20 percent since early October. On Tuesday, the energy sector of the S&P 500 was the worst performing part of the stock market.\r\n\n中国是世界上最大的石油消费国，也一直对大宗商品有很大影响。自10月初以来，油价目前略高于每桶53美元，跌幅超过20%。周二，标准普尔500指数的能源板块是股市表现最差的板块。\r\n\nWeakness in China is feeding broader global concerns. Last quarter, the country’s growth slowed to its lowest level since 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis.\r\n\n中国的疲弱正在引发更广泛的全球关注。上一季度，在全球金融危机低谷之时，该国的增长放缓至2009年以来的最低水平。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nJapan is also looking shaky, with the economy contracting in the third quarter. And Germany, the powerhouse behind Europe, shrank unexpectedly during the third quarter as well.\r\n\n由于第三季度经济萎缩，日本也看起来不稳定。而欧洲的经济强国德国也在第三季度意外萎缩。\r\n\nThe global slowdown could eventually spill over into the United States, particularly as the impact of this year’s tax cuts fades in 2019. For investors, that could mean a choppy new phase in the markets after years of solid gains.\r\n\n全球经济放缓可能最终波及美国，特别是今年减税措施的影响在2019年消退时。对于投资者来说，这可能意味着经过多年的稳定增长后，市场将进入一个动荡的新阶段。\r\n\n“I think this is what a low-return environment starts to feel like,” said Joe Davis, chief economist with Vanguard. “The past five years, although entirely welcome from an investment standpoint, is clearly unsustainable.”\r\n\n“我认为这就是低回报环境开始的感觉，”先锋集团(Vanguard)首席经济学家乔·戴维斯(Joe Davis)说。“过去五年虽然从投资的角度来看非常令人愉快，但显然是不可能一直持续下去的。”\r\n\n翻译：晋其角\r\n"
