Then, just four hours into her day, she picked up a call from what seemed like a very familiar voice.\n　　周一莫罗第一天上班。前4个小时里，她接到了数起报警电话，其中包括一起入室抢劫案及一起住房着火事件。就在她上班整整4个小时的时候，她接到了一通电话，而且电话中传出的是她非常熟悉的声音。\n　　“I heard her voice, and I saw her name pop up on the screen. I was like, ‘Wait. This is my aunt,’” said Morrow. “I did freeze. Like I really, my hands froze over the keyboard but I knew I had to go ahead and get it in.” Her aunt was calling for help because Crystal’s father had gone into diabetic shock.\n　　莫罗说：“我听到了她的声音，又在屏幕上看到了她的名字。我当时一愣，等会，这不是我姑妈吗?我整个人都僵住了，手停在键盘上，但我知道我必须马上接入这通电话。” 莫罗的阿姨的确是打电话来求助，莫罗的父亲因糖尿病发作休克了。\n　　“Because of so many people being in the room, I didn’t think that I would get the call and it’s crazy that I got it on the very first day,” said the rookie 911 operator. While she was panicking inside, she learned from her training to remain calm and was able to process the emergency call with her aunt.\n　　这位新手接线员感叹道：“房间里有那么多接线员，怎么正好是我接到这通电话，而且今天还是我第一天上班。”尽管内心有些恐慌，但经过培训的她告诉自己必须要保持镇定，这使得她能够专业的处理自己姑妈的报警电话。\n　　Throughout the exchange, there was no indication that Morrow was distressed. Morrow walked her aunt step-by-step through what needed to be done and sent an ambulance to her father. The caller never knew that the 911 operator who was helping her was her niece.\n　　在整个交谈过程中，莫罗并没有表现出紧张担心的情绪。莫罗一步步地告诉她的姑妈需要采取哪些步骤，并往家中派去了一辆救护车。莫罗的姑妈一直不知道与她通话的911接线员就是她侄女。\n　　Danielle Harvey, Ms. Morrow’s colleague and the woman who trained her for the job, interestingly said that trainees are taught on the first day to field calls from family members. “She handled it well. She took the entire call.”\n　　训练莫罗的是她的同事丹妮尔・哈维。哈维说巧合的是，受训者第一天接受的训练就是如何处理自己家人的电话。“莫罗干得不错，顺利完成了整个接听任务。”"
