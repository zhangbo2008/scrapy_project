"China’s Fan Bingbing to Pay Huge Tax Fine\nChinese officials have ordered “X-Men” actor Fan Bingbing to pay $130 million in taxes and fines. The move ends the mystery over her disappearance from public view three months ago.\r\n\n中国官员已命令“X战警”演员范冰冰支付1.3亿美元的税款和罚款。 这一举动结束了三个月前她从公众视野中失踪的神秘面纱。\r\n\nFan Bingbing is one of China’s most famous actors. In 2016, Forbes listed her as one of the highest paid female actors in the world.\r\n\n范冰冰是中国最着名的演员之一。 2016年，福布斯将她列为全球收入最高的女演员之一。\r\n\nChina’s state news agency Xinhua reported that Fan would not be investigated for the crime of tax evasion as long as she pays the taxes, fines and late fees of almost 900 million yuan, about $130 million.\r\n\n中国国家新闻机构新华社报道说，只要她支付近9亿元人民币（约1.3亿美元）的税款，罚款和滞纳金，范就不会因偷税罪被调查。\r\n\nThe Xinhua report said Fan avoided taxes by making a $20-million secret performance contract for the Chinese film “Unbreakable Spirit.”\r\n\n新华社报道说，范为中国电影“坚不可摧的精神”制作了价值2000万美元的秘密演出合同，从而避免了税收。\r\n\nIt is a common custom in Chinese show business for actors to make one private contract with high pay and another public contract showing much lower pay. The report said the investigation serves as a warning to all show business performers in China.\r\n\n对于演员来说，制定一份高薪私人合约和另一份显示薪酬低得多的公共合约是中国演艺界的常见习惯。 该报告称调查是对中国所有演艺界人士的警告。\r\n\nFan apologized on the social media site Weibo.com: “I am unworthy of the trust of the society and let down the fans who love me.”\r\n\n范在社交媒体网站Weibo.com上道歉：“我不配社会的信任，让那些爱我的粉丝失望。”\r\n\n女演员范冰冰于2018年5月8日在法国南部戛纳举行的第71届国际电影节开幕式上。\n\r\n\nChina’s Fan Bingbing to Pay Huge Tax Fine\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n  \nMP3Player('data/Fanpay.mp3')\n\r\n  \n  \n  \r\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 audio with speed controls.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n调整语速:\r\n\r\n\n70%\n\r\n\n80%\n\r\n\n90%\n\r\n\n100%\n\r\n\n150%\n\r\n\n\r\nvar mp3file = document.getElementById(\"theMP3\");\r\nfunction setPlaySpeed(speed) {\r\n    mp3file.playbackRate = speed;\r\n}\r\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n<!--\r\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-3135658776052410\";\r\n/* mingshi */\r\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"4998228531\";\r\ngoogle_ad_width = 336;\r\ngoogle_ad_height = 280;\r\n//-->\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\n\r\n\nChinese officials have ordered “X-Men” actor Fan Bingbing to pay $130 million in taxes and fines.
