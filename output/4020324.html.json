No survivors have been reported since 172 people were saved from the ship and sea on the day the ferry sank.\n　　Park said the coast guard's rescue operations actually failed in the ferry sinking accident, noting that after much contemplation, she reached a conclusion that the coast guard will be disbanded.\n　　The Ministry of Security and Public Administration will focus solely on the task of public administrations, and the task of maritime guard and rescue will be transferred to the tentatively named \"National Safety Office\" that will be launched and serve as a control tower of rescue operations.\n　　The task of marine transport control center from the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries will also be moved to the National Safety Office, Park said.\n 韩国总统朴槿惠19日就上月发生的沉船事件正式向全体国民道歉，同时宣布解散救援不力的海洋警察厅。\n　　朴槿惠在当天上午的电视直播讲话中向蒙受痛苦的民众道歉，并承担未能及时妥善处理好此次事故的最终责任。她说，一定不会让珍贵的生命白白牺牲。\n　朴槿惠说，韩国海警在此次事故救援中未能尽到应有的责任，若在事故发生后及时开展积极救援，伤亡肯定会大大减少。鉴于韩国海警自身存在很多问题，经过深 思熟虑，决定解散海洋警察厅，其职能分别移交警察厅和新设立的国家安全处。此外，安全行政部、海洋水产部等部门也面临职能调整。\n　　谈及本次事故的原因，朴槿惠认为，是船长和部分船员的失职、船体结构改造和超载等共同造成的。她提议制订特别法，组建由朝野官员及民间人士共同参与的真相调查委员会。朴槿惠表示，政府正着手改革不合理的制度，纠正不正常的习惯性行为。\n　　载有476人的“岁月”号客轮上月16日在韩国全罗南道珍岛郡屏风岛以北海域意外进水倾覆，仅有172人获救。事故已造成包括4名中国乘客在内的286人遇难，仍有18人失踪。"
