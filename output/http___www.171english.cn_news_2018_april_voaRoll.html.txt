Military bands and games are also part of the customary trappings of the event.\r\nThe White House Easter Egg Roll has a long tradition, dating back to 1878 when President Rutherford B. Hayes hosted the first one. \r\nThere were no egg rolls between 1917 to 1920 because of World War One. Similarly, during World War Two, no egg rolls were held from 1943 to 1945. \r\nFood conservation efforts and then construction on the White House also brought a halt to the celebrations from 1946 to 1952. \r\nHowever, President Dwight Eisenhower reinstated the White House Easter Egg Roll in 1953. \r\n缇庡浗鎬荤粺鐗规湕鏅拰绗竴澶汉姊呮媺灏间簹鏄熸湡涓�鍦ㄧ櫧瀹崡鑽夊潽涓惧姙涓�骞翠竴搴︾殑澶嶆椿鑺傛粴褰╄泲娲诲姩銆�\r\n鍙傚姞杩欎釜娲诲姩鐨勪汉鍦ㄤ簩鏈堢殑涓�娆″叕寮�鎶界涓耽寰椾簡鍏ュ満鍒搞��\r\n鐧藉璇达紝鏄熸湡涓�杩欏ぉ鏄悇绉嶅悇鏍风殑瀹跺涵娲诲姩銆�\r\n鐧藉澶嶆椿鑺傛椿鍔ㄥ寘鎷効绔ュ拰浠栦滑鐨勫浜虹敤瓒呭ぇ鐨勫嫼瀛愬湪鐧藉鑽夊潽涓婂悜鍓嶆帹鏈ㄥご鍒朵綔鐨勫僵铔嬨��\r\n鐧藉澶嶆椿鑺傛粴褰╄泲娲诲姩鏈夋偁涔呯殑鍘嗗彶锛屽彲杩芥函鍒�1878骞淬�傛椂浠绘�荤粺娴锋柉涓捐浜嗙涓�娆℃椿鍔ㄣ��\r\n鐢变簬绗竴娆′笘鐣屽ぇ鎴橈紝鐧藉浠�1917骞村埌1920骞存病鏈変妇鍔炲娲昏妭婊氬僵铔嬫椿鍔ㄣ�傚悓鏍凤紝鍦ㄧ浜屾涓栫晫澶ф垬鏈熼棿锛�1943骞村埌1945骞翠篃娌℃湁涓惧姙杩欎釜娲诲姩銆�\r\n\r\nU.S. first lady Melania Trump smiles after reading the children's book \"Party Animals\" at the 139th annual White House Easter Egg Roll\r\n\r\n涓轰簡鑺傜害绮鍜屽鐧藉杩涜淇籍锛�1946骞村埌1952骞存病鏈変妇琛屽娲昏妭婊氬僵铔嬫椿鍔ㄣ��\r\n鑹炬．璞▉灏旀�荤粺1953骞存仮澶嶄簡鐧藉鐨勮繖涓紶缁熴��"
