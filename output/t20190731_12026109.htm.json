The weight and span of the swivel bridge refreshed the world record.\n　　A spherical hinge, which is the \"axis\" supporting the rotating body, is a major piece of equipment used to turn the bridge. The diameter of the spherical hinge used in the project reached 6.5 meters, setting a new world record.\n　　China has adopted the swivel construction method in building many bridges. The method helps overcome the constraints of environment and traffic, while shortening the construction period."
