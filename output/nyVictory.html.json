That could lead to gridlock.\r\n\n民主党人还必须要找到一种平衡，一方面是实现立法上的抱负，一方面又要满足其选民的要求，对总统展开调查。这可能导致僵局的出现。\r\n\n“The expectation is that we will behave as a real branch of government and not just a supplicant to Trump, which this current Congress has been for the last two years,” said Representative Raúl Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona. “There’s an expectation that we’re a check and a balance so that means a stalemate.”\r\n\n“人们期望我们将成为一个真正的政府部门，而不是特朗普的哀求者，就像本届国会在过去两年中的那个样子，”亚利桑那州民主党众议员劳尔·格里哈尔瓦(Raul Grijalva)说。“人们期待我们成为一种分立制衡的力量，这就意味着有可能导致僵局。”\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nMidterm elections are always a referendum on the president, and never more so than in 2018, when Mr. Trump told voters across the country that he was on the ballot. Historically, the party out of power picks up seats in the first midterm of a presidency, and Democrats followed that pattern this year.\r\n\n中期选举向来是对总统的一场全民公投，在2018年尤其如此，因为特朗普告诉全国各地的选民，他的名字也在选票上。从历史上看，在总统任期的第一个中期选举中，失去总统大权的党派会获得多数席位，民主党人今年也依循了这一规律。\r\n\nUnlike the midterms of 2006, when President George W. Bush declared that Democrats had delivered “a thumping,” or 2010, when President Barack Obama described Republicans’ victory as “a shellacking,” the Democrats did not score an overwhelming victory Tuesday night. Republicans are likely to expand their majority in the Senate, and Democrats lost some governorships that they badly wanted, especially in Ohio and Florida.\r\n\n2006年的中期选举中，美国总统乔治·W·布什宣布，民主党出了“一记重拳”，而在2010年，奥巴马总统将共和党人的胜利称为“惨败”，与这两次不同，周二晚上，民主党人并没有取得压倒性的胜利。共和党人可能会扩大他们在参议院的多数席位；而在一些他们非常想赢得的州，民主党人失去了州长席位，特别是俄亥俄州和佛罗里达州。\r\n\nBut they do have a lot to celebrate. Democrats not only won the districts they were favored in, but locked up many where they were not. In New York, Max Rose, a health care executive and Army veteran, ousted Representative Dan Donovan, the only Republican member of New York City’s congressional delegation, in a race that analysts had said leaned Republican.\r\n\n但他们确实有很多值得庆祝的事情。民主党不仅在他们受欢迎的选区赢得了胜利，而且赢下了很多并不青睐他们的地方。在纽约，医疗企管人士和陆军退伍军人马克斯·罗斯(Max Rose)把纽约市国会代表团中的唯一共和党成员丹·多诺万(Dan Donovan)赶下了台，分析人士本来认为，这场选举有利于共和党人。\r\n\nIn Texas, Democrat Colin Allred, a former N.F.L. player and civil rights lawyer, defeated the incumbent Republican, Pete Sessions. In Illinois, Lauren Underwood beat Representative Randy Hultgren, a Republican who won by 19 points in 2016.\r\n\n在德克萨斯州，前NFL球员和民权律师、民主党人科林·奥尔雷德(Colin Allred)击败了在任的共和党人皮特·塞申斯(Pete Sessions)。在伊利诺伊州，劳伦·安德伍德(Lauren Underwood)击败了共和党众议员兰迪·霍尔格伦(Randy Hultgren)，后者在2016年以19点的优势获胜。\r\n\nAnd in Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former C.I.A. official, unseated Representative Dave Brat, a Tea Party darling who himself scored a huge upset four years ago when he defeated his predecessor, Eric Cantor, the Republican leader, in a Republican primary.\r\n\n在弗吉尼亚州，前中情局官员、民主党人阿比盖尔·斯潘伯格(Abigail Spanberger)取代了茶党宠儿戴夫·布拉特(Dave Brat)，后者四年前在共和党初选中击败其前任、共和党领袖埃里克·康托尔(Eric Cantor)，引发了巨大的混乱。\r\n\nIn a year when Mr. Trump put racial divisiveness on the ballot, Democrats ran and won with a diverse set of candidates who are infusing the party with new energy. Many are from the party’s progressive wing. Newcomers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist from New York, and Ayana Pressley of Massachusetts will almost certainly take the lead in pressing for a liberal agenda.\r\n\n这一年里，特朗普让种族分歧成为投票中的重要因素，而民主党人让多元的候选人参加竞选，并赢得胜利，为民主党注入了新的活力。他们中的许多人来自该党的进步派。纽约的亚历山德里娅·奥卡西奥-科尔特兹(Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez)自称为民主社会主义者，她和马萨诸塞州的阿亚娜·普莱斯利(Ayana Pressley)这样的新人几乎肯定会率先推动自由主义议程。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nDemocratic leaders plan to satisfy those demands by using their newfound majority to push through long-stalled initiatives that they say have broad support within the electorate. High on their list of priorities is gun safety legislation, legislation to offer a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented young people known as Dreamers, and a bill to extend broad civil rights protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.\r\n\n利用他们新获得的多数地位，民主党领导人计划推动他们认为在选民中得到广泛支持、但是长期停滞不前的行动，从而满足这些要求。他们的优先事项清单中最重要的是枪支安全立法、为被称为“梦想者”(Dreamer)的无身份证明年轻人提供公民身份的立法，以及将广泛的民权保护扩展到男女同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者的法案。\r\n\nAt the same time, Democrats must be careful not to overreach. Progressives will almost certainly clamor for Mr. Trump’s impeachment — a push that Democratic leaders have indicated that they will resist, at least until Mr. Mueller releases his findings.\r\n\n与此同时，民主党人必须小心不要过度。进步人士几乎肯定会要求弹劾特朗普——民主党领导人表示他们会反对这一要求，至少是在穆勒发布调查结果之前。\r\n\n“Everybody understands that we have to choose our battles very carefully now,” Mr. Raskin said. “We have to make sure that we are advancing a common sense majority platform that America wants, and let’s hope that we can bring Republicans aboard with us.”\r\n\n“每个人都明白，我们现在必须非常谨慎地选择战斗，”拉斯金说。“我们必须确保我们正在推进一个合乎常理的多数派纲领，那才是美国需要的，但愿我们能把共和党人争取过来。”\r\n\nThat may be overly optimistic, especially with Republicans in control of the Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has shown little inclination to cooperate with Democrats, and is unlikely to do so without a nudge from Mr. Trump. And Mr. Trump himself may be in no mood to cooperate once Democrats start demanding documents — including, perhaps, the president’s tax returns.\r\n\n这可能过于乐观，尤其是在共和党人控制参议院的情况下。多数党领袖、肯塔基州参议员米奇·麦康奈尔(Mitch McConnell of Kentucky)并没有表现出与民主党人合作的倾向，如果没有特朗普的推动，他也不太可能这样做。一旦民主党人开始要求提供文件——特别是总统的纳税申报表——特朗普本人也可能没有心情开展合作。\r\n\nMr. Trump is already anticipating as much — and gave a hint earlier this week of how he will react to Democrats’ demands.\r\n\n特朗普已经预料到了这一点，并在本周早些时候暗示他将如何应对民主党人的要求。\r\n\n“I don’t care,” he told reporters. “They can do whatever they want and I can do whatever I want.”\r\n\n“我不在乎，”他对记者说。“他们想怎么干就怎么干，我也想怎么干就怎么干。”\r\n\n翻译：杜然、晋其角\r\n"
