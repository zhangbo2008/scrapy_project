'He wasn't going home until he got those flowers,' Officer Brian Grigsby said.\n　　警官特洛伊・迪拉德告诉CBS新闻记者，“老人相当固执。”布莱恩・格雷斯比警官补充道，“他非要买到花之后才肯回家。”\n　　'That's what he wanted. He wanted flowers for his wife, because tomorrow was Mother's Day.'\n　　“这就是他想要的，他想给妻子买鲜花，因为明天就是母亲节了。”\n　　So the officers decided to help Melvyn Amrine achieve his goal, secretly stopping in at a local supermarket and helping him select a bouquet of beautiful cream-colored roses.\n　　所以警察就决定帮助梅尔文・爱莫林完成目标，在附近的超市偷偷停下来、帮他挑选了一大束奶油色的玫瑰。\n　　'We had to get those flowers,' Grigsby says. 'We had to get them. I didn't have a choice.'\n　　“我们必须弄到那些鲜花，” 警官格雷斯比说，“我们必须买到鲜花交到他手中，别无选择。”\n　　The kind officers even surruptitiously slipped the cashier some extra bills when Melvyn couldn't cover the tab.\n　　善良的警察甚至还在梅尔文・爱莫林付账钱不够的时候，偷偷地塞给收银员一些额外的小费。\n　　A frantic Doris Amrine was relieved when she saw her husband of 60 years walking up their front stairs in the company of the police officers, but her relief turned to joy when he presented her with the carefully selected bouquet.\n　　和妻子结婚已有60年的丈夫在警察的陪同下出现在家中的前楼梯，惊慌的妻子多莉丝・爱莫林看到丈夫终于松了一口气，随即在看到精心挑选的花束之后、多莉丝欣喜若狂。\n　　'As he came up those steps, and I saw those roses and the smile on his face, I just broke inside,' Doris told CBS. 'I just said, thank you, thank you. Because I saw his heart.'\n　　“当他走上那几阶台阶时，我看见了玫瑰以及他脸上的微笑，当时我的心就被触动了。”多莉丝告诉CBS记者，“我高兴得无以言表，只是说谢谢、谢谢。因为我看到了他对我的真心。”\n　　'It's special, because even though the mind doesn't remember everything, the heart remembers.'\n　　\"这很特别，因为即使大脑没有了记忆，心仍会记得爱。\""
