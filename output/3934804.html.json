Using name of Pak Un, Swiss authorities were told that Kim was the son of an employee at North Korea’s embassy when he enrolled in August 1998.\n　　据了解，金正恩上学期间一直未向老师和同学公开真实身份。1998年入学时，瑞士官方仅被告知他是朝鲜使馆某雇员之子。\n　　Friends have said he was “obsessed” with basketball and showed “absolutely no interest” in politics。\n　　据朋友介绍，金正恩“痴迷于”篮球，看上去对政治“毫无兴趣”。\n　　As the photographs emerged, South Korea warned that the North could be planning a fourth nuclear test to ramp up tensions ahead of President Obama's upcoming visit to Seoul。\n　　目前韩国警告称由于奥巴马即将访问韩国，为制造紧张局势，朝鲜或正为第四次核试验做准备。\n　　\"Our military is currently detecting a lot of activity in and around the Punggye-ri nuclear test site,\" said Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the Defence ministry。\n　　韩国国防部新闻发言人表示，“根据我军监测，目前朝鲜核试验基地丰溪里附近活动频繁。”"
