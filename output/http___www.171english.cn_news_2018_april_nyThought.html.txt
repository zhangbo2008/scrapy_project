"By PHILIP GALANES; APRIL 5, 2018 涓嫳瀵圭収\r\nI am a 15-year-old girl with a problem that鈥檚 going to make me sound super-spoiled. I get excited for the holidays, especially (and selfishly) about the gifts I鈥檓 going to get. But every year, I end up bummed out. Like: 鈥淩eally, Mom? A bracelet for a 10-year-old?鈥� It happened again this year. I know the holidays aren鈥檛 about gifts, but I can鈥檛 help feeling as if the people who get me presents don鈥檛 even know me. Any advice?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnonymous, Albany\r\n\r\n\r\nFor one Christmas, we should all be 10-year-old gay boys, circa 1975: old enough to feel vaguely ashamed of being different 鈥� not that we should, but remember, this is 1975 鈥� and no chance of telling our parents what we really want. (Hello, Easy-Bake Oven!) So we make up something that a 鈥渘ormal鈥� boy may like, but we never wanted it. That pitiful cycle cured me of gift dissatisfaction for life. I never expect to like gifts; I鈥檓 only grateful for the giver鈥檚 effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to tamp down your expectations, Sweetie. We all have mysterious hearts, even you 鈥� maybe especially you. It鈥檚 next to impossible for parents to keep up with quick-change teen tastes. Focus on your mom, instead: driving to the jewelry store and wandering the aisles, somehow walking out with a gift for a little girl. Doesn鈥檛 that make you feel better about her lousy bracelet? It should. If not, work hard in school. Then, when you鈥檙e a successful adult, you can buy the things you really want for yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuest of Horror\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of our holiday party, a friend asked if he could bring a guest. We said yes. When they showed up, his guest (whom we had never met) saw our dog and screamed. She demanded that the dog be 鈥減ut away.鈥� But we live in an open loft; there was no place to put him. We explained that our dog is old and friendly, but the guest refused to come in and our friend was furious. What should we have done?\r\n\r\n\r\nL.C., New York\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is it always the uninvited guests who swan in with the greatest sense of entitlement? You did exactly what you should have: apologize sweetly for the impossibility of acceding to her demands. If you wanted to go the extra mile (not that you should have), you could have offered to put your dog on a leash. But that only raises another question: With you and your partner scurrying around as party hosts, who would hold the other end of it? We鈥檙e all entitled to our fears, but that doesn鈥檛 give us the right, as guests, to reorder our host鈥檚 universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving a Paper Trail\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a new law school grad and looking for a job. I have been interviewing with partners at law firms and others. Typically, I follow up with thank-you emails within 24 hours and handwritten notes a few days after that. But my adviser thinks that handwritten notes are unnecessary these days, and my husband thinks they make me look like a schoolgirl. What about you?\r\n\r\n\r\nKatrina Robinson, New York\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturally, I disagree. (But that鈥檚 what makes a horse race.) I see no downside in taking a second crack at reminding hiring people of your existence. If that makes us 鈥渟choolgirls,鈥� in your husband鈥檚 view, sign me up for a pinafore 鈥� and our new employer鈥檚 dental plan. One caveat: do more in the handwritten notes than repeat the contents of your initial emails. Hunt around for articles your interviewers have written or cases they won, and mention them. (Flattery is one of life鈥檚 best lubricants.)\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, remember the wisdom of the 鈥�80s pop star Karla Bonoff and pretend she was referring to the limits of thank-you notes when she sort of sang: You can mail it in, you can phone it in, you send it in by your closest kin 鈥� but you鈥檙e only getting that second interview if they liked you personally, yeah, personally.\r\n\r\n\r\nDriving You Mad\r\n\r\n\r\nA couple I know hosts an annual gumbo party for New Year鈥檚. Three years ago, I scraped the side of another guest鈥檚 car as I was leaving. I thought it was shrubbery, but the next morning, I saw what had happened. I called the host immediately and covered the other guest鈥檚 damage. Trouble is, this other guest continues to rib me about the accident every year. I want to move on from it. But I only see these folks at the party, and I don鈥檛 feel like having a heart-to-heart. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\n\r\nOther than a hearing test? (Does metal scraping metal really sound like the brush of privet to you?) No, the reason this guy keeps ribbing you is precisely because he sees you only once a year. To him, your sideswipe is the most memorable thing about you. If you want the teasing to stop, get to know each other better at the party (so he has some competing information) or invite him to your place during the year. Two more thoughts: A sassy quip guarantees that your lousy driving will be etched in acid on this guy鈥檚 brain.
