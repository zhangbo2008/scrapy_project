"By GRETCHEN REYNOLDS; APRIL 5, 2018 涓嫳鍙岃瀵圭収闃呰\r\nIn the days before the London Marathon last year, scientists from the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in England approached female racers at the event鈥檚 registration center and asked them to complete an anonymous questionnaire about their exercise habits and breast health.\r\n\r\n\r\nSore breasts are a common experience among women of all ages and sizes, athletes and nonathletes alike.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut scientists had not examined whether and to what extent exercise contributes to breast pain and, conversely, whether and to what extent breast pain alters how women exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo they surveyed almost 1,300 of the women registered for the race and learned, as their new study, published in March in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, makes clear, that exercise does significantly impact breast pain and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should surprise no one, of course, that exercise influences breasts, just as it does virtually every tissue in the male and female body.\r\n\r\n\r\nFemale breast tissue is unusual, however, being weighty, even in small-breasted women, but with little natural anatomical support. As a result, unconstrained breasts move independently when a woman does, and that movement is exacerbated during exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier motion-capture research by the Portsmouth scientists established that unsupported female breasts 鈥� that is, those not contained within a bra 鈥� oscillate as much as eight inches in space when a woman runs, and not just up and down, but also side to side, forward and backward.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven when the volunteers wore a standard sports bra, the scientists found their breasts often continued to sway considerably during running.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut whether this breast motion was linked to later soreness was unclear.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is why the researchers now set out to examine the real-world consequences of being an active woman and having sore breasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚t is an important quality of life issue for women,鈥� said Nicola Brown, a member of the Research Group in Breast Health at Portsmouth, a lecturer in exercise science at Saint Mary鈥檚 University College in London and the lead author of the study.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also an issue with too many dimensions to effectively study in a single laboratory experiment, so the scientists decided instead to survey a cross section of active women. And contrary to popular belief, a cross section of active women is what the registration roll of a major marathon conveniently provides.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淪ome people have the perception that female marathon runners鈥� are all slender and boyish, as elite racers often are, 鈥渁nd don鈥檛 have breasts,鈥� Dr. Brown said, but she and her collaborators focused their study on the London Marathon鈥檚 鈥渕ass-participation runners, who are a variety of shapes and sizes,鈥� she said.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the scientists analyzed the surveys from these runners, they found that they had data about women with 56 different bra sizes, from an AA cup to an HH and chest-band sizes from 28 to 40 inches. The women ranged widely in body weight, too, with the average being about 148 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than 90 percent reported that they always wore a bra, including during exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut these active women were not immune from breast pain. More than a third reported that their breasts were frequently were sore, although not necessarily because of exercise. Sore breasts most commonly were because of hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle, the runners reported.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incidence of breast pain was highest among the women with the largest breasts. More than half of those wearing an F cup or larger reported frequent breast pain. But smaller-breasted women also were affected; about 25 percent of those who wore an A cup or smaller said that their breasts often were sore.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotherhood reduced the likelihood that a woman would report breast pain, perhaps, the authors speculate, because pregnancy and breast-feeding alter the composition of the breasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the researchers found particularly striking was that, for many of the women, exercise induced or aggravated breast soreness and, in consequence, breast pain often altered how the women trained. About a quarter of those with sore breasts said that they reduced the intensity of their workouts when their breasts hurt 鈥� walking in lieu of running, for example 鈥� while others skipped exercise altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn aggregate, Dr. Brown said the results suggest that exercise-related breast pain can compromise the quality and quantity of physical activity for many women.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, many of us might consider that a self-evident finding 鈥� anecdotal evidence suggests that my friends and I complain all the time about how our breasts feel when we鈥檙e running. But this is the first study to formally examine and validate the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also, Dr. Brown said, 鈥渉ighlights the importance and significance of research into the treatment of breast pain.鈥� A well-fitting, supportive bra, she said, has been shown to lessen breast pain in about 85 percent of women with the condition. But a large number of women, including by inference many of the London runners, are not wearing the right bra.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Research Group in Breast Health has published a handy online guide to bra fitting. But far more research is needed into sports bra design, Dr. Brown said, an undertaking that she hopes will progress rapidly, having herself just completed her first marathon and been hampered occasionally during training by sore breasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圙RETCHEN REYNOLDS锛�\r\nIn the days before the London Marathon last year, scientists from the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in England approached female racers at the event鈥檚 registration center and asked them to complete an anonymous questionnaire about their exercise habits and breast health.\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄥ幓骞寸殑浼︽暒椹媺鏉惧紑璧涘嚑澶╁墠锛屾潵鑷嫳鍥芥湸鑼ㄨ寘鏂ぇ瀛�(University of Portsmouth)涔虫埧鍋ュ悍鐮旂┒灏忕粍鐨勭鐮斾汉鍛樹滑鏉ュ埌璧涗細娉ㄥ唽涓績锛屾壘鍒颁簡鍙傝禌濂抽�夋墜锛屽苟璇峰ス浠畬鎴愭湁鍏宠繍鍔ㄤ範鎯笌涔虫埧鍋ュ悍鐨勫尶鍚嶉棶鍗疯皟鏌ャ��\r\n\r\n\r\nSore breasts are a common experience among women of all ages and sizes, athletes and nonathletes alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄥ悇涓勾榫勬銆佸悇绉嶄綋鍨嬨�佽繍鍔ㄤ範鎯悇寮傜殑濂虫�т腑锛屼钩鎴跨柤鐥涙槸涓�绉嶅父瑙佺殑缁忓巻銆�\r\n\r\n\r\nBut scientists had not examined whether and to what extent exercise contributes to breast pain and, conversely, whether and to what extent breast pain alters how women exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗙鐮斾汉鍛樻鍓嶅苟涓嶄簡瑙ｈ繍鍔ㄦ槸鍚︿笌涔虫埧鐤肩棝鏈夊叧锛屾湁澶氬ぇ鐨勫叧鑱旓紝鍙嶄箣锛屼粬浠篃涓嶄簡瑙ｄ钩鎴跨柤鐥涙槸鍚﹀奖鍝嶄簡濂虫�у弬涓庤繍鍔紝褰卞搷绋嬪害濡備綍銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo they surveyed almost 1,300 of the women registered for the race and learned, as their new study, published in March in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, makes clear, that exercise does significantly impact breast pain and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n浜庢槸浠栦滑璋冩煡浜嗚繎1300浣嶆姤鍚嶅弬鍔犺禌浜嬬殑濂抽�夋墜锛屼粬浠殑杩欓」鏂扮爺绌跺彂鐜帮紝杩愬姩纭疄鏄捐憲閫犳垚浜嗕钩鎴跨柤鐥涳紝鍙嶄箣浜︾劧銆傝繖椤规姤鍛婂垔鐧诲湪浜嗐�婅嫳鍥借繍鍔ㄥ尰瀛﹀鍒娿��(The British Journal of Sports Medicine)3鏈堝彿鏉傚織涓娿��\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should surprise no one, of course, that exercise influences breasts, just as it does virtually every tissue in the male and female body.\r\n\r\n\r\n褰撶劧锛屽緱鐭ヨ繍鍔ㄤ細褰卞搷涔虫埧锛岃偗瀹氭病浜轰細澶т负鎯婂锛屾瘯绔熻繍鍔ㄤ簨瀹炰笂浼氬奖鍝嶇敺鎬т笌濂虫�ц韩浣撶殑姣忎竴涓粍缁囥��\r\n\r\n\r\nFemale breast tissue is unusual, however, being weighty, even in small-breasted women, but with little natural anatomical support.
