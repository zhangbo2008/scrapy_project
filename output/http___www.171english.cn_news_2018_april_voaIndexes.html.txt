"US Stock Indexes Plunge\r\nWASHINGTON 鈥� U.S. stocks plunged again Monday after President Donald Trump unleashed a new verbal attack on giant online retailer Amazon and China fired its shot at U.S. imports in a developing trade war.\r\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 589 points by the close, shedding 1.9 percent. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 2.3 percent while the NASDAQ fell nearly three percent at the end of trading.\r\nTrump has strongly criticized Amazon three times in the last few days. Amazion founder Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post, whose revelatory stories on Trump and his administration frequently draw the president's ire.\r\nThe U.S. leader says Amazon's large-scale operations are detrimental to the business success of small retailers that cannot compete with its high-volume sales. Trump has also complained that the fees Amazon pays to the U.S. Postal Service to deliver merchandise the retailer sells are too low, costing the quasi-governmental agency hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue, although the Postal Service says its contract with Amazon is profitable.\r\n\"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,\" Trump said in his latest broadside against Amazon. \"THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!\" \r\nSince Trump started verbally attacking Amazon, the company has lost more than $37 billion in market value.\r\nChina's announcement that it is increasing duties on 128 categories of U.S. imports worth $3 billion in annual trade also worried investors. They fear Beijing's response to the Trump tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports could spark an all-out trade war between the world's two biggest economies.\r\nAtsi Sheth, an analyst for Moody's Investors Service, said, \"The importance of tariff announcements by both the U.S. and China lies in what they may portend for overall bilateral trade and investment relations between the two countries.\"\r\nLate Monday, White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters issued a statement saying, in part, that China needs to stop \"its unfair trading practices which are harming U.S. national security and distorting global markets.\"\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�3鏃� 浣滆��:缇庡浗涔嬮煶甯冮浄寰疯繄灏�(Ken Bredemeier)\r\n鍗庣洓椤� 鈥� 鍦ㄥ窛鏅�荤粺瀵圭編鍥界綉涓婇浂鍞法澶翠簹椹�婂叕鍙歌繘琛屾柊鐨勮█杈炴敾鍑讳互鍙婁腑鍥藉湪姝ｅ湪褰㈡垚鐨勮锤鏄撴垬涓杩涘彛缇庡浗鍟嗗搧鍙戣捣鍥炲嚮涔嬪悗锛岀編鍥借偂鎸囨槦鏈熶竴澶ц穼鍋氭敹銆�\r\n閬撶惣鏂伐涓氬钩鍧囨寚鏁版敹鐩樻椂璺岃惤589鐐癸紝璺屽箙杈�1.9%锛屾爣鍑嗘櫘灏�500鎸囨暟涓嬫尗2.3%锛� 绾虫柉杈惧厠鎸囨暟鏀剁洏鏃堕噸鎸繎3%銆�\r\n杩囧幓鍑犲ぉ閲岋紝宸濇櫘涓夋鐚涚儓鎶ㄥ嚮浜氶┈閫婂叕鍙搞�備簹椹�婂垱濮嬩汉鏉板かo璐濅綈鏂悓鏃舵嫢鏈夈�婂崕鐩涢】閭姤銆嬶紝杩欏鎶ョ焊鏈夊叧宸濇櫘鍙婂叾琛屾斂褰撳眬鐖嗘枡鎬х殑鎶ラ亾缁忓父鎷涜嚧宸濇櫘鎬荤粺鐨勬�掔伀銆�\r\n杩欎綅缇庡浗鎬荤粺琛ㄧず锛屼簹椹�婂ぇ瑙勬ā鐨勭粡钀ユ椿鍔ㄨ灏忛浂鍞晢鏃犳硶绔炰簤锛岀粰浠栦滑甯︽潵浼ゅ銆傚窛鏅繕鎶辨�ㄤ簹椹�婂叕鍙告敮浠樼粰缇庡浗閭斂灞�(USPS)鐨勫揩閫掕祫璐瑰お浣庯紝浣垮緱杩欎釜鍑嗘斂搴滄満鏋勬瘡骞存崯澶辨暟浜跨編鍏冪殑鏀跺叆銆備笉杩囷紝缇庡浗閭斂灞�琛ㄧず涓庝簹椹�婂叕鍙镐箣闂寸殑鍚堝悓鏄泩鍒╃殑銆�\r\n\r\n绾界害鑲＄エ浜ゆ槗鎵�鐨勪氦鏄撳晢浠�傦紙2018骞�3鏈�29鏃ワ級\r\n\r\n宸濇櫘鍦ㄥ鎶ㄥ嚮浜氶┈閫婄殑鏈�鏂版姩鍑讳腑璇达紝鈥滃彧鏈夊偦鐡滐紝鎴栬�呮洿宸殑浜猴紝鎵嶄細璇翠簹椹�婂叕鍙歌姝ｅ湪浜忔崯鐨勭編鍥介偖鏀垮眬璧氶挶銆傞偖灞�璧斾簡澶ч挶锛岃繖绉嶆儏鍐典細鏀瑰彉鐨勩�傛澶栵紝鍏ㄧ編鍚勫湴璇氬疄缂寸◣鐨勯浂鍞晢姝ｅ湪鍊掗棴锛屸�︹�﹁繖涓嶆槸涓�涓叕骞崇殑绔炰簤鐜锛佲��\r\n鑷粠宸濇櫘寮�濮嬭█杈炴姩鍑讳簹椹�婁互鏉ワ紝璇ュ叕鍙稿凡缁忔崯澶变簡370澶氫嚎缇庡厓鐨勫競鍊笺��\r\n涓浗瀹ｅ竷灏嗗骞村害浠峰��30浜跨編鍏冪殑128绫荤編鍥借繘鍙ｅ晢鍝佸鏀跺叧绋庯紝杩欎篃璁╂姇璧勮�呮劅鍒版媴蹇冦�備粬浠鎬曞寳浜宸濇櫘鍚戜环鍊�500浜跨編鍏冪殑涓浗杩涘彛鍟嗗搧寰佹敹楂橀鍏崇◣鍋氬嚭鐨勫洖鍑诲彲鑳藉紩鍙戣繖涓や釜涓栫晫鏈�澶х粡娴庝綋涔嬮棿鐨勫叏闈㈣锤鏄撴垬銆�\r\n绌嗚开鎶曡祫鏈嶅姟鏈烘瀯鐨勫垎鏋愬笀闃跨壒瑗縪濉炴柉璇达細鈥滅編鍥藉拰涓浗鍙屾柟瀹ｅ竷寰佹敹鍏崇◣鐨勯噸瑕佹�у湪浜庝粬浠彲鑳芥槸鏈夊叧涓ゅ浗涔嬮棿鏁翠綋鍙岃竟璐告槗鍜屾姇璧勫叧绯荤殑鍧忓厗澶淬�傗��\r\n鏄熸湡涓�鏅氶棿锛岀櫧瀹壇鏂伴椈绉樹功鏋楄禌o娌冨皵鐗规柉鍙戣〃澹版槑璇达紝涓浗闇�瑕佸仠姝⑩�滃叾鎹熷浜嗙編鍥藉浗瀹跺畨鍏ㄥ苟浣挎壄鏇插叏鐞冨競鍦虹殑涓嶅叕骞宠锤鏄撳仛娉曘�傗��"
