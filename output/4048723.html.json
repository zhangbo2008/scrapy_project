One day you can’t imagine your life without running, and the next you may be cursing at yourself (while running, of course) for getting started with this crazy sport.\n　　每一段感情都会有起起落落，同样你对跑步的爱也不例外。今天你还觉得你的生活不能没有跑步，明天可能又会骂自己(当然边跑边骂)当初怎么会开始这么疯狂的运动。\n　　If you have moments when your love for running is fading (and who doesn’t?), here are some ways to re-ignite the spark:\n　　假如你觉得你对跑步的热爱逐渐冷却(谁不会这样呢?)，以下几个方法能让你对跑步爱火重燃：\n　　1. Talk to other runners.\n　　和志同道合的跑步爱好者交流\n　　Whether you're discussing your past glory days or future running goals, talking about running with other runners can help remind you of why you feel in love with it in the first place.\n　　无论是谈论曾经的辉煌还是畅想未来的目标，和志同道合的跑步爱好者交流心得，这可以提醒你当初为什么会爱上跑步。\n　　2. Buy yourself some new running gear.\n　　为自己添置跑步新装备\n　　Treat yourself to some new running gear, such as a new shirt or running socks, as a reward for your hard work. The treat will make you feel energized, and reinforce your commitment to your training. After all, who doesn’t look forward to wearing that new, cool-looking running gear on a long run? If you don’t need any new gear, a massage or pedicure is always a nice reward.\n　　买点新的跑步“神器”犒劳一下自己――一件新运动衫或一双运动袜――作为你努力的奖赏。奖励能让你活力满格，精神振奋，坚定你继续锻炼的决心。毕竟人靠衣装嘛!谁不想身着拉风的新装备长跑呢!如果不需要添置新装备，那么按摩或足疗永远是不错的奖励哦。\n　　3. Display your bling.\n　　展示你的战绩\n　　Having visual reminders of your running accomplishments can help keep you motivated to get out there again (and collect more bling). Get one of those cool medal hanging racks to keep your race medals organized and add some visual interest to one of your walls.\n　　用看得见的方式证明你跑步的成就，这可以持续激发你对跑步(并获得更多战绩)的热情。买一台酷炫的奖牌挂架，将你的奖牌整齐有序地挂好，为你的墙壁增添一些视觉亮点吧!\n　　4. Mentor a new runner.\n　　发展新的跑步爱好者\n　　One way to show yourself how far you’ve come is to share your running knowledge and experience with others. If you have a family member or friend who's expressed an interest in running, ask her if she'd like to join you for a run (at her pace), needs help shopping for running shoes and gear, or maybe even wants to train for a race together. Not only will helping a new runner allow you to see and celebrate your progress, but you’ll also get a motivation boost.\n　　与他人分享你的运动知识与经历，这也是一种展示跑步成果的方法。如果有家人或朋友同你表示跑步的兴趣，不妨问问她是否愿意以她习惯的速度和你一起跑步，是否需要你帮她选购跑鞋和其他装备，以及是否想和你一起为参赛集训。帮助一个跑步新手不仅能让你们共同见证和庆祝你的进步，更能让你动力大爆发。"
