That has led to worries that the coming winter could once again see choking haze many times the safe levels recommended by the World Health Organization.\r\n\n中国生态环境部上个月发布了针对东北28个城市的年度督导计划，该计划在一定程度上放宽了新的减排要求，并取消了去年冬天实施的一些迫使许多钢铁厂、炼焦厂和其他工厂关闭了几个月的限制措施。这让人们担心，在即将到来的冬天可能会再次看到令人窒息的、浓度是世界卫生组织(WHO)建议的安全水平数倍的雾霾。\r\n\nThe country’s pollution — measured by the concentration of PM 2.5, or particulate matter of a size deemed especially harmful — has been blamed for as many as one million premature deaths a year.\r\n\n这个国家的污染——由PM2.5这种被认为特别有害的颗粒物的浓度所测量——被认为是导致每年一百万人过早死亡的罪魁祸首。\r\n\nThe main particulate matter in pollution in China has long been thought to be sulfate, a product of sulfur dioxide released by burning coal. But another sulfur molecule, hydroxymethane sulfonate, is also a significant contributor, according to the study, conducted with scientists from Tsinghua University in Beijing and the Harbin Institute of Technology in Harbin, the capital of China’s northernmost province, Heilongjiang.\r\n\n长期以来，人们一直认为中国污染的主要颗粒物是硫酸盐，一种燃煤释放的二氧化硫的产物。但一项由北京清华大学和位于中国最北部省份黑龙江省首府哈尔滨的哈尔滨工业大学的科学家进行的研究表明，另一种硫分子，羟基甲烷磺酸盐，也是一个重要来源。\r\n\nThe molecule is formed by a chemical reaction between formaldehyde and sulfur dioxide, and explains why “extreme air pollution events” have persisted despite the efforts to cut sulfur emissions, the researchers found.\r\n\n研究人员发现，这种分子是由甲醛和二氧化硫之间的化学反应形成的，这也解释了为什么尽管努力减少二氧化硫的排放，“极端空气污染事件”仍然持续存在。\r\n\nSteven Lee Myers是《纽约时报》驻京记者。\r\n\n\r\nClaire Fu对本文有研究贡献。\r\n\n\r\n翻译：Huayizi Chen\r\n"
