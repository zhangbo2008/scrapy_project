"By Pamela Druckerman; APRIL 5, 2018 涓嫳鍙岃瀵圭収闃呰\r\nPARIS 鈥� ONE of the many problems with parenting is that kids keep changing. Just when you鈥檙e used to one stage, they zoom into another. I realized this was happening again recently, when my 8-year-old asked me about babies. She knows they grow in a mother鈥檚 belly, but how do they get in there to begin with?\r\n\r\n\r\nI wasn鈥檛 sure how much to reveal, so I stalled. 鈥淚鈥檒l tell you soon,鈥� I said, adding, 鈥渋t involves penises.鈥� I didn鈥檛 want to shock her or shatter her innocence. Like any good American, I鈥檇 assumed that one day (many years hence) we鈥檇 have that stilted conversation in which I鈥檇 reveal the strange mechanics of sex, and she鈥檇 tell me that she already knew all about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I live in France, I decide to investigate how Europeans approach this. Do parents give their kids the birds-and-bees talk, too? Is the subject any less awkward here? Is there some savoir-faire to help me navigate this next phase and beyond?\r\n\r\n\r\nI begin my research at a Parisian science museum with an exhibition, Zizi sexuel l鈥檈xpo, (its English title is Sex 鈥� Wot鈥檚 the Big Deal?) to teach 9- to 14-year-olds about sexuality. There鈥檚 advice about kissing. (Do turn your head sideways, 鈥渆specially if you鈥檝e got a big nose.鈥� Don鈥檛 do the 鈥渃offee grinder,鈥� where you spin your tongue in the other person鈥檚 mouth.) In the puberty section, I鈥檓 asked to identify a smell (it鈥檚 armpit) and step on a pedal that makes small white balls 鈥� representing sperm 鈥� fly out of a pretend penis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere鈥檚 also a whole section on how complicated love is. One sign explains that 鈥渓oving someone sometimes makes you happy and sometimes makes you really sad. But even when you鈥檙e upset, you still want to love and be loved because it makes you feel so alive.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French aren鈥檛 paragons of sex education. Though schools are required to teach it, they often don鈥檛. Instead of 鈥渢he talk,鈥� French children typically get 鈥渢he book,鈥� says Philippe Brenot, a sexologist. 鈥淚n general that鈥檚 what it is in France. At 12, 13, 14 years old, it鈥檚, 鈥楬ere, take this and read it.鈥� 鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the exhibition, these books (at least the ones I鈥檝e seen; there are dozens) give clear information on how not to get pregnant or catch an infection, and stress that you should have sex only when you鈥檙e absolutely ready. But the overarching message is that if you use protection, and you鈥檙e in a healthy relationship, sex can be something quite great.\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently, the Dutch are at the forefront of sex education, and they have little trouble broaching the topic. Parents in the Netherlands have lots of casual age-appropriate talks about sex with their kids, over many years, beginning when children are small. Mandatory sex education begins in elementary school, and includes lessons on respecting people who are transgender, bisexual or gay.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚f we start with sexuality education when children are teenagers, or even just before they start with any interest in sexuality, I think you are too late,鈥� says Sanderijn van der Doef, a psychologist with the Dutch sexual-health group Rutgers WPF. 鈥淎s soon as children have questions, they have the interest, and then they have the right to get a correct answer.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Van der Doef says parents should give simple, clear responses. If the child has more questions, he鈥檒l ask. Once he鈥檚 3 or 4, 鈥淵ou can start to explain, in a very simple way, that Mommy has a little egg in her belly, Daddy has very small sperms in his body, and when the sperms meet the egg, a baby grows in the belly of the mother.鈥� Three-year-olds rarely ask how the sperm and egg meet. If they do, 鈥渢hen you have a very smart child at that age, and that means that child needs to have an answer,鈥� she adds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sociologist Amy Schalet, author of 鈥淣ot Under My Roof,鈥� says Dutch parents 鈥渘ormalize鈥� sex for adolescents, too. They typically allow 16- and 17-year-olds to have sleepovers at home, if they鈥檙e in a stable, loving relationship, are using contraception and are emotionally ready. By contrast, American parents tend to 鈥渄ramatize鈥� sex: highlighting its dangers, forbidding it at home and leading teenagers to have it in secret, Ms. Schalet writes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Americans and Europeans typically have intercourse for the first time around age 17. But here, parents are more inclined to accept that. A French friend told me that when she tried to enter her spare bedroom recently, it was locked from inside. After a minute, her 17-year-old popped his head out and said sheepishly, 鈥淲e鈥檙e in here.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚t was so cute,鈥� my friend told me. Crucially, her son was with his long-term girlfriend. And pregnancy probably wasn鈥檛 an issue: In France, birth-control pills are free to 15- to 18-year-olds, with a prescription, and minors can walk into any pharmacy and get the morning-after pill free. (The Dutch rules are similar.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI鈥檓 not sure my American friends would find this scene 鈥渃ute.鈥� But consider that Europe鈥檚 teenage pregnancy rates are far lower than in the United States 鈥� in France and Holland, they鈥檙e nearly five times lower. It seems that if you treat teenagers as if they鈥檙e responsible, they can live up to that.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, my kids aren鈥檛 at this stage yet. But armed with my new research, I find a casual moment to discuss baby making with my daughter. After I calmly tell her the penis-meets-vagina story, she seems unsurprised. 鈥淥h, you mean making love,鈥� she says. 鈥淚 read about that in one of my books.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nPamela Druckerman, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of 鈥淏ringing Up B茅b茅: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting.鈥�\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛堝笗姊呮媺路寰烽瞾鍏嬫浖锛�\r\nONE of the many problems with parenting is that kids keep changing.
