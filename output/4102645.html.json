Often there were long periods of awkward silence as the person tried to come up with some excuse, but usually they bought.\n　　这在销售中很管用，而且也能运用到其他方面。我过去的老板培训我而且给我指标，我以前在体育馆销售会员卡。他告诉我一旦我说完销售目的和报价后就不要说话了，接下来第一个说话的人就输了。当顾客努力想找出不办卡的借口时，往往有很长时间都是尴尬的沉默，但是他们最后总是会买的。\n　　4.

So I'm not in danger.\"\n　　当我们吃东西的时候，我们的大脑会推断：“如果我现在处境危险的话我就不会正在吃东西了。所以我现在是安全的。“\n　　6.
