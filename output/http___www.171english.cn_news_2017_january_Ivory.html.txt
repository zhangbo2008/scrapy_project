Firing volleys into the air from Kalashnikov rifles and heavy weapons outside a government facility, a mob of angry soldiers trapped the nation's defense minister and other officials inside the building nuntil late Saturday evening.\r\nIn addition to Defense Minister Alain-Richard Donwahi, the mayor of Bouake city, other government representatives and local journalists were among those held hostage, reports from the scene said. Soldiers could be heard shouting that they wanted promised cash bonuses paid immediately, not next week.\r\nAfter several hours, however, the defense minister and the others were released. Donwahi, who had earlier been quoted as saying the protesters' demands were \"understandable but regrettable,\" headed to the airport immediately and left town.\r\nEarlier Saturday, shooting broke out at a military base in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's commercial capital, and soldiers barricaded key roads there, evoking memories of a nearly identical mutiny by soldiers two years ago. However, amid the tensions in the country's two largest cities, there were no reports of shots being directed at people, or any casualties.\r\nLess than two hours before the outburst by soldiers in Bouake, President Ouattara announced he would meet the rebellious soldiers' demands. He gave no details but asked all members of the military to return to their barracks. National television reported the settlement took into account the mutineers' \"demands relating to bonuses and improving the living conditions of soldiers.\""
