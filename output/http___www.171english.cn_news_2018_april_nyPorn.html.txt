"By PEGGY ORENSTEIN; APRIL 5, 2018 涓嫳鍙岃瀵圭収闃呰\r\nTHE other day, I got an email from a 21-year-old college senior about sex 鈥� or perhaps more correctly, about how ill equipped she was to talk about sex. The abstinence-only curriculum in her middle and high schools had taught her little more than 鈥渄on鈥檛,鈥� and she鈥檇 told me that although her otherwise liberal parents would have been willing to answer any questions, it was pretty clear the topic made them even more uncomfortable than it made her.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo she had turned to pornography. 鈥淭here鈥檚 a lot of problems with porn,鈥� she wrote. 鈥淏ut it is kind of nice to be able to use it to gain some knowledge of sex.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish I could say her sentiments were unusual, but I heard them repeatedly during the three years I spent interviewing young women in high school and college for a book on girls and sex. In fact, according to a survey of college students in Britain, 60 percent consult pornography, at least in part, as though it were an instruction manual, even as nearly three-quarters say that they know it is as realistic as pro wrestling. (Its depictions of women, meanwhile, are about as accurate as those of the 鈥淭he Real Housewives鈥� franchise.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statistics on sexual assault may have forced a national dialogue on consent, but honest conversations between adults and teenagers about what happens after yes 鈥� discussions about ethics, respect, decision making, sensuality, reciprocity, relationship building, the ability to assert desires and set limits 鈥� remain rare. And while we are more often telling children that both parties must agree unequivocally to a sexual encounter, we still tend to avoid the biggest taboo of all: women鈥檚 capacity for and entitlement to sexual pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt starts, whether intentionally or not, with parents. When my daughter was a baby, I remember reading somewhere that while labeling infants鈥� body parts (鈥渉ere鈥檚 your nose,鈥� 鈥渉ere are your toes鈥�), parents often include a boy鈥檚 genitals but not a girl鈥檚. Leaving something unnamed, of course, makes it quite literally unspeakable.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor does that silence change much as girls get older. President Obama is trying 鈥� finally 鈥� in his 2017 budget to remove all federal funding for abstinence education (research has shown repeatedly that the nearly $2 billion spent on it over the past quarter-century may as well have been set on fire). Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fewer than half of high schools and only a fifth of middle schools teach all 16 components the agency recommends as essential to sex education. Only 23 states mandate sex ed at all; 13 require it to be medically accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the most comprehensive classes generally stick with a woman鈥檚 internal parts: uteruses, fallopian tubes, ovaries. Those classic diagrams of a woman鈥檚 reproductive system, the ones shaped like the head of a steer, blur into a gray Y between the legs, as if the vulva and the labia, let alone the clitoris, don鈥檛 exist. And whereas males鈥� puberty is often characterized in terms of erections, ejaculation and the emergence of a near-unstoppable sex drive, females鈥� is defined by periods. And the possibility of unwanted pregnancy. When do we explain the miraculous nuances of their anatomy? When do we address exploration, self-knowledge?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo wonder that according to the largest survey on American sexual behavior conducted in decades, published in 2010 in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, researchers at Indiana University found only about a third of girls between 14 and 17 reported masturbating regularly and fewer than half have even tried once. When I asked about the subject, girls would tell me, 鈥淚 have a boyfriend to do that,鈥� though, in addition to placing their pleasure in someone else鈥檚 hands, few had ever climaxed with a partner.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoys, meanwhile, used masturbating on their own as a reason girls should perform oral sex, which was typically not reciprocated. As one of a group of college sophomores informed me, 鈥淕uys will say, 鈥楢 hand job is a man job, a blow job is yo鈥� job.鈥� 鈥� The other women nodded their heads in agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrustrated by such stories, I asked a high school senior how she would feel if guys expected girls to, say, fetch a glass of water from the kitchen whenever they were together yet never (or only grudgingly) offered to do so in return? She burst out laughing. 鈥淲ell, I guess when you put it that way,鈥� she said.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rise of oral sex, as well as its demotion to an act less intimate than intercourse, was among the most significant transformations in American sexual behavior during the 20th century. In the 21st, the biggest change appears to be an increase in anal sex. In 1992, 16 percent of women aged 18 to 24 said they had tried anal sex. Today, according to the Indiana University study, 20 percent of women 18 to 19 have, and by ages 20 to 24 it鈥檚 up to 40 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA 2014 study of 16- to 18-year-old heterosexuals 鈥� and can we just pause a moment to consider just how young that is? 鈥� published in a British medical journal found that it was mainly boys who pushed for 鈥渇ifth base,鈥� approaching it less as a form of intimacy with a partner (who they assumed would both need to be and could be coerced into it) than a competition with other boys. They expected girls to endure the act, which young women in the study consistently reported as painful. Both sexes blamed the girls themselves for the discomfort, calling them 鈥渘a\"ive or flawed,鈥� unable to 鈥渞elax.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Debby Herbenick, director of the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University and one of the researchers on its sexual behavior survey, when anal sex is included, 70 percent of women report pain in their sexual encounters. Even when it鈥檚 not, about a third of young women experience pain, as opposed to about 5 percent of men. What鈥檚 more, according to Sara McClelland, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, college women are more likely than men to use their partner鈥檚 physical pleasure as the yardstick for their satisfaction, saying things like 鈥淚f he鈥檚 sexually satisfied, then I鈥檓 sexually satisfied.鈥� Men are more likely to measure satisfaction by their own orgasm.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor McClelland writes about sexuality as a matter of 鈥渋ntimate justice.鈥� It touches on fundamental issues of gender inequality, economic disparity, violence, bodily integrity, physical and mental health, self-efficacy and power dynamics in our most personal relationships, whether they last two hours or 20 years. She asks us to consider: Who has the right to engage in sexual behavior? Who has the right to enjoy it? Who is the primary beneficiary of the experience? Who feels deserving? How does each partner define 鈥済ood enough鈥�? Those are thorny questions when looking at female sexuality at any age, but particularly when considering girls鈥� formative experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are learning to support girls as they 鈥渓ean in鈥� educationally and professionally, yet in this most personal of realms, we allow them to topple. It is almost as if parents believe that if they don鈥檛 tell their daughters that sex should feel good, they won鈥檛 find out. And perhaps that鈥檚 correct: They don鈥檛, not easily anyway. But the outcome is hardly what adults could have hoped.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat if we went the other way? What if we spoke to kids about sex more instead of less, what if we could normalize it, integrate it into everyday life and shift our thinking in the ways that we (mostly) have about women鈥檚 public roles? Because the truth is, the more frankly and fully teachers, parents and doctors talk to young people about sexuality, the more likely kids are both to delay sexual activity and to behave responsibly and ethically when they do engage in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider a 2010 study published in The International Journal of Sexual Health comparing the early experiences of nearly 300 randomly chosen American and Dutch women at two similar colleges 鈥� mostly white, middle class, with similar religious backgrounds. So, apples to apples. The Americans had become sexually active at a younger age than the Dutch, had had more encounters with more partners and were less likely to use birth control. They were also more likely to say that they鈥檇 first had intercourse because of pressure from friends or partners.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn subsequent interviews with some of the participants, the Americans, much like the ones I met, described interactions that were 鈥渄riven by hormones,鈥� in which the guys determined relationships, both sexes prioritized male pleasure, and reciprocity was rare. As for the Dutch? Their early sexual activity took place in caring, respectful relationships in which they communicated openly with their partners (whom they said they knew 鈥渧ery well鈥�) about what felt good and what didn鈥檛, about how far they wanted to go, and about what kind of protection they would need along the way. They reported more comfort with their bodies and their desires than the Americans and were more in touch with their own pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat鈥檚 their secret? The Dutch said that teachers and doctors had talked candidly to them about sex, pleasure and the importance of a mutual trust, even love. More than that, though, there was a stark difference in how their parents approached those topics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the survey did not reveal a significant difference in how comfortable parents were talking about sex, the subsequent interviews showed that the American moms had focused on the potential risks and dangers, while their dads, if they said anything at all, stuck to lame jokes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDutch parents, by contrast, had talked to their daughters from an early age about both joy and responsibility. As a result, one Dutch woman said she told her mother immediately after she first had intercourse, and that 鈥渕y friend鈥檚 mother also asked me how it was, if I had an orgasm and if he had one.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE, according to Amy T. Schalet, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and the author of 鈥淣ot Under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex, 鈥� young Dutch men expect to combine sex and love. In interviews, they generally credited their fathers with teaching them that their partners must be equally up for any sexual activity, that the women could (and should) enjoy themselves as much as men, and that, as one respondent said, he would be stupid to have sex 鈥渨ith a drunken head.鈥� Although she found that young Dutch and American men both often yearned for love, only the Americans considered that a personal quirk.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought about all of that that recently when, driving home with my daughter, who is now in middle school, we passed a billboard whose giant letters on a neon-orange background read, 鈥淧orn kills love.鈥� I asked her if she knew what pornography was. She rolled her eyes and said in that jaded tone that parents of preteenagers know so well, 鈥淵es, Mom, but I鈥檝e never seen it.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nI could鈥檝e let the matter drop, felt relieved that she might yet make it to her first kiss unencumbered by those images.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoodness knows, that would鈥檝e been easier. Instead I took a deep breath and started the conversation: 鈥淚 know, Honey, but you will, and there are a few things you need to know.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrection: March 27, 2016 \r\n\r\nAn opinion essay last Sunday about teenage girls and sex misstated, in two instances, the name of the school where some of the research it described was conducted; it is Indiana University, not the University of Indiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeggy Orenstein, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine, is the author, most recently, of 鈥淕irls and Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape,鈥� from which this essay is adapted.\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛堜僵鍚壜峰ゥ浼︽柉鍧︼級\r\nTHE other day, I got an email from a 21-year-old college senior about sex 鈥� or perhaps more correctly, about how ill equipped she was to talk about sex.

In the 21st, the biggest change appears to be an increase in anal sex. In 1992, 16 percent of women aged 18 to 24 said they had tried anal sex. Today, according to the Indiana University study, 20 percent of women 18 to 19 have, and by ages 20 to 24 it鈥檚 up to 40 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n鍙ｄ氦鐨勫叴璧凤紝浠ュ強鍏惰闄嶆牸涓虹浉姣旀�т氦娌￠偅涔堜翰瀵嗙殑琛屼负锛屾槸20涓栫邯缇庡浗浜烘�ц涓虹殑鏈�閲嶅ぇ杞彉涔嬩竴銆傚湪21涓栫邯锛屾渶澶х殑鍙樺寲浼间箮鏄倹浜ょ殑澧炲銆�1992骞达紝18鍒�24宀佸コ鎬т腑鏈�16%鐨勪汉琛ㄧず鏇惧皾璇曡倹浜ゃ�傛嵁鍗扮瀹夌撼澶у(Indiana University)鐨勭爺绌讹紝濡備粖18鍒�19宀佺殑濂虫�ф湁20%灏濊瘯杩囷紝鑰屽埌浜�20鍒�24宀佸垯涓婂崌鍒�40%銆�\r\n\r\n\r\nA 2014 study of 16- to 18-year-old heterosexuals 鈥� and can we just pause a moment to consider just how young that is? 鈥� published in a British medical journal found that it was mainly boys who pushed for 鈥渇ifth base,鈥� approaching it less as a form of intimacy with a partner (who they assumed would both need to be and could be coerced into it) than a competition with other boys.

Even when it鈥檚 not, about a third of young women experience pain, as opposed to about 5 percent of men. What鈥檚 more, according to Sara McClelland, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, college women are more likely than men to use their partner鈥檚 physical pleasure as the yardstick for their satisfaction, saying things like 鈥淚f he鈥檚 sexually satisfied, then I鈥檓 sexually satisfied.鈥� Men are more likely to measure satisfaction by their own orgasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n鎹嵃绗畨绾冲ぇ瀛︽�у仴搴峰浼犱腑蹇�(Center for Sexual Health Promotion)涓讳换榛涙瘮路璧湰灏煎厠(Debby Herbenick)璇达紝涓�鏃﹀瓨鍦ㄨ倹浜わ紝鏈�70%鐨勫コ鎬ф姤绉板ス浠湪鎬т氦杩囩▼涓劅鍒扮棝妤氥�傝但鏈凹鍏嬪弬涓庝簡璇ヤ腑蹇冭繘琛岀殑鎬ц涓鸿皟鐮斻�傚嵆渚挎病鏈夎倹浜わ紝涔熸湁澶х害涓夊垎涔嬩竴鐨勫勾杞诲コ鎬ф湁鐤肩棝鎰熷彈锛岀浉姣斾箣涓嬬敺鎬у彧鏈夌害5%銆傛澶栵紝鎹瘑瑗挎牴澶у(University of Michigan)蹇冪悊瀛﹀鑾庢媺路楹﹀厠鑾卞皵鍏板痉(Sara McClelland)璇达紝澶у濂虫�т細姣旂敺鎬ф洿澶氬湴浣跨敤浼翠荆鐨勮韩浣撴剦鎮︿綔涓轰釜浜烘�ф弧瓒崇殑琛￠噺鏍囧噯锛屽ス浠細璇粹�滃鏋滀粬寰楀埌鎬ф弧瓒筹紝鎴戝氨寰楀埌浜嗘�ф弧瓒炽�傗�濈敺浜哄垯鏇村鍦颁娇鐢ㄨ嚜韬殑鎬ч珮娼綔涓烘弧瓒崇殑鏍囧噯銆�\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor McClelland writes about sexuality as a matter of 鈥渋ntimate justice.鈥� It touches on fundamental issues of gender inequality, economic disparity, violence, bodily integrity, physical and mental health, self-efficacy and power dynamics in our most personal relationships, whether they last two hours or 20 years. She asks us to consider: Who has the right to engage in sexual behavior? Who has the right to enjoy it? Who is the primary beneficiary of the experience? Who feels deserving? How does each partner define 鈥済ood enough鈥�? Those are thorny questions when looking at female sexuality at any age, but particularly when considering girls鈥� formative experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n楹﹀厠鑾卞皵鍏板痉鏁欐巿鎾版枃璁鸿堪浜嗘�т腑鐨勨�滀翰瀵嗘涔夆�濋棶棰樸�傝繖瑙﹀強浜嗘�у埆涓嶅钩绛夈�佺粡娴庡樊寮傘�佹毚鍔涖�佽韩浣撳畬鏁存�с�佽韩浣撲笌绮剧鍋ュ悍銆佽嚜鎴戞晥鑳姐�佹潈鍔涘姩鎬佺瓑鏍规湰闂锛岃繖浜涢棶棰樺湪缁濆ぇ澶氭暟涓汉鍏崇郴涓瓨鍦ㄧ潃锛屾棤璁烘槸鎸佺画浜嗕袱涓皬鏃惰繕鏄簩鍗佸勾銆傚ス瑕佹垜浠�濊�冭繖浜涢棶棰橈細璋佸湪鎬ц涓轰腑鎷ユ湁涓诲姩鏉冿紵璋佹湁浜彈鎬х殑鏉冨埄锛熻皝鏄�т綋楠岀殑棣栬鍙楃泭浜猴紵璋佽寰楄繖鏄嚜宸卞簲寰楃殑锛熶即渚ｅ弻鏂瑰浣曞畾涔夆�滆冻澶熷ソ鈥濓紵瀵逛换浣曞勾榫勬鐨勫コ鎬х殑鎬т簨锛岃繖浜涢兘鏄鎵嬬殑闂锛岀劧鑰屽畠浠湪濂冲鐨勬垚闀挎湡浣撻獙涓挨鍏堕噸瑕併��\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are learning to support girls as they 鈥渓ean in鈥� educationally and professionally, yet in this most personal of realms, we allow them to topple.
