"When I was a freshman at the University of California, Riverside, in 1988, I drove a carload of excited fellow Vietnamese students to nearby Orange County. It was only 13 years after the end of the Vietnam War, but already there was a Vietnamese American Dream, symbolized by our destination, the Asian Garden Mall in Westminster. To the strains of Vietnamese pop music, we ate Vietnamese food, browsed Vietnamese goods, and sat in the balcony of the American-style mall, sipping Vietnamese iced coffee while we watched Vietnamese people.\r\n\n1988年，当我还是加州大学河滨分校(University of California, Riverside)的一名新生时，我开车带着一大帮兴奋的越南同学来到附近的奥兰治县。那时，越南战争结束仅13年，但一个越南美国梦已经形成了，我们的目的地威斯敏斯特市的亚洲花园购物中心(Asian Garden Mall)就是这梦想的象征。在越南流行音乐声中，我们吃越南菜，浏览越南商品，坐在美式商场的阳台上，边看越南人边喝越南冰咖啡。\r\n\nThe mall was the heart of the Little Saigon in Orange County. By 1988, Little Saigon was already firmly established, with multitudes of Vietnamese shops, restaurants and businesses lining Bolsa Avenue. This community was populated with Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese refugees who had fled the end of the war. It was deeply anti-Communist. Orange County as a whole was also anti-Communist and quite conservative, but it was also very white at the time. The arrival of so many refugees from Vietnam in the 1970s and 1980s was not welcomed by everyone in Westminster and Orange County.\r\n\n这个购物中心是奥兰治县小西贡的中心。到1988年，小西贡已经稳固地建立起来，博尔萨大道上有许多越南商店、餐馆和公司。这个社区聚集着战争结束时逃离出来的越南和华裔难民。这里是非常反共产主义的。奥兰治县总体就是反共且相当保守的，但在那时也非常的白。20世纪70年代和80年代，威斯敏斯特和奥兰治县的所有人并不欢迎大量越南难民的到来。\r\n\nThirty years later, Westminster has a Vietnamese-American mayor, and Orange County has elected several Vietnamese-American politicians. Most have been Republicans, and vocally anti-Communist. But Communism is no longer the national issue it once was, and while the older generation of Vietnamese-Americans tends to be Republican and conservative, the younger generation has largely abandoned the Republican Party, either to become Democrats or independents. These shifts point toward larger changes in the once staunchly Republican Orange County, which is today leaning more Democratic and independent. The political changes are at least partly due to demographics in a county that is now one-fifth Asian and one-third Latino, whereas in 1980 four out of five residents were non-Latino white.\r\n\n30年后，威斯敏斯特有了一位越南裔美国人市长，奥兰治县选出了几位越南裔美国人政客。大多数人都是共和党人，并且是坚决的反共产主义人士。但共产主义不再是曾经的国家问题，虽然老一辈的越南裔美国人往往是共和党和保守派，但年轻一代在很大程度上放弃了共和党，要么成为民主党人，要么成为无党派人士。这些转变指向曾经坚定倾向共和党的奥兰治县在整体上的变化，今天，它更倾向于民主党和独立派。政治上的变化至少部分归因于一个县的人口构成，现在奥兰治县拥有五分之一的亚裔和三分之一的拉丁裔，而在1980年，五分之四的居民是非拉丁裔的白人。\r\n\nThis mix of demographics and ideology in Orange County may be one of the prime reasons the Republican Party is committed to an anti-immigration agenda that seeks to turn America back to before 1965. It was then that a new law, the Immigration and Naturalization Act, created a more equitable immigration policy. For decades before, the United States had kept people out who came from Africa, Asia or Latin America, beginning with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. If you hail from one of those continents, the 1965 Immigration Act has mostly been a success.

Forget for the moment that a “merit”-based policy would have kept out many white immigrants of earlier generations, as well as recent Asian immigrants. Family reunification has brought many Asian immigrants into this country and helped to make Asian-Americans the fastest growing minority population. If the Republican Party vastly restricts family reunification, it could be dead to an overwhelming majority of Asian-American voters.\r\n\n虽然他可能很难做到这一点，但许多共和党人正在推行严格限制家庭团聚移民，转而支持所谓的以价值为基础的移民。他们忘了，基于“价值”的政策会阻止许多较早几代的白人移民，以及最近的亚洲移民。家庭团聚移民使许多亚洲移民进入这个国家，并帮助亚裔美国人成为增长最快的少数族裔人口。如果共和党极大限制家庭团聚移民，那么可能会失去绝大多数亚裔选民的选票。\r\n\nThe idea of Orange County, and even Little Saigon, becoming enthusiastically or even reluctantly Democratic appeals to me, who only travels to Orange County for the great Vietnamese food — the best outside of Vietnam, just as the county is home to the largest Vietnamese population outside of the homeland. But if the Democratic Party assumes that demographics equal political fate, it may be in for disappointment. This is because the Asian-American community is diverse in so many ways, including in its political beliefs and passions.\r\n\n奥兰治县乃至小西贡开始热情地、甚至勉强地支持民主党的想法，让我很感兴趣，尽管我去奥兰治县，只是为了那里美味的越南菜——那里拥有越南以外地方能吃到的最棒的越南菜，正如该县拥有越南之外最大的越南裔群体。但如果民主党认为人口构成等同于政治命运，那结果可能会令人失望。因为亚裔美国人社区在很多方面都是多种多样的，包括政治信仰和激情。\r\n\nIn Orange County, one of the largest mobilizations of Asian-American voters happened in opposition to a county attempt to house homeless people in each of the county’s cities. Asian-Americans in tonier places like Irvine were vocal in rejecting the county plan. The Vietnamese-American leadership of Westminster went against California’s sanctuary state status. Nationally, the issue of affirmative action in college admissions, particularly in the Ivy League, has fractured the Asian-American community. While most Asian-Americans support affirmative action, many Chinese-Americans do not, and they have been vigorous in their opposition.\r\n\n在奥兰治县，亚裔美国选民中最大的动员活动之一，是反对该县试图在其每个城市里安置无家可归者的行动。在欧文这样较为繁华地区的亚裔美国人发声反对这项县计划。威斯敏斯特的越南裔美国领袖反对加州的庇护州地位。在全国范围内，大学（特别是常春藤联盟学校）在招生中适用平权行动的问题，已经使亚裔美国人社区分裂。多数亚裔美国人支持平权行动，但也有许多不支持，而且持非常坚定的反对意见。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nProperty and education, in Orange County and nationally, thus remain possible ways that the Republican Party can appeal to Asian-American voters. The Orange County columnist Gustavo Arellano argues, “The Republican Party can survive in an increasingly diverse America if it makes Asians ‘white.’” The seduction of whiteness has long been there for Asian-Americans, some of whom have periodically sought alliance with whites, and vice versa, ever since plantation owners in the 19th century brought Chinese workers to the South as possible replacements for black workers. Such tentative seductions have generally been undermined by events like Japanese-American internment and the Vietnam War, which convinced many Asian-Americans that they were not white.\r\n\n在奥兰治县和全国范围内，财产和教育仍然是共和党用于吸引亚裔美国选民的可能途径。奥兰治县的专栏作家古斯塔沃·阿雷拉诺(Gustavo Arellano)说，“共和党可以在日益多元化的美国生存下来，如果它能让亚洲人‘变白’。”自从19世纪的种植园主把华工带到南方，作为黑人工人的可能替代品以来，对于亚裔美国人来说，成为白人的诱惑一直存在着，他们当中的一些人不断寻求与白人结盟，反之亦然。这种暂时性的诱惑往往受到日裔美国人拘禁营和越南战争等事件的破坏，后者使许多亚裔美国人明白他们不是白人。\r\n\nToday, once again, the Republican Party is fumbling another opportunity to appeal to Asian-Americans who are willing to align themselves with whiteness. And that’s because its coded racial appeals to Asian-Americans on middle-class issues like education, clean streets and safe neighborhoods are being drowned out by its coded racial appeals to whites on immigration.\r\n\n今天，在吸引愿意与白人保持一致的亚裔美国人的行动中，共和党再次搞砸了。这是因为它对亚裔美国人在教育、街道卫生和社区安全等中产阶级问题上的潜在种族吸引力，正被其对白人在移民问题上的隐晦种族吸引力所淹没。\r\n\nThis is ironic because, from the vantage point of Little Saigon and many other parts of Orange County where Asian-Americans and Latinos have built thriving communities, it is immigration that has kept the region economically vibrant, culturally colorful and gastronomically interesting. Cutting back harshly on immigration, which the Republican Party says will help America, will only hurt it instead — and reduce the already waning appeal of the Republican Party to Asian-Americans.\r\n\n这很讽刺，因为，站在小西贡以及奥兰治县其他地方的角度看，亚裔和拉丁裔美国人已经建起了繁荣的社区，是移民为那里带去了活跃的经济、多彩的文化和丰盛的美食。共和党所说的大幅削减移民，只会令它受到伤害——并且进一步减少共和党对亚裔美国人已经逐渐减弱的吸引力。\r\n\nViet Thanh Nguyen是时报观点作者。他是最近出版的《难民》(The Refugees)一书的作者，也是《流离失所者：难民生活中的难民作家》(The Displaced: Refugee Writers on Refugee Lives)一书的编辑。他在南加州大学教授英文。\r\n\n\r\n翻译：Shuhua、晋其角\r\n"
