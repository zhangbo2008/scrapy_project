"\r\n\nNavigating a new place can be challenging no matter where in the world it is, but certain cities make day-to-day living a lot easier than others.\nThese ‘most liveable cities’ are ranked every year by The \nEconomist Intelligence Unit\n, which rounds up 140 of the world’s biggest cities and ranks each one according to more than 30 factors that influence liveability, including safety, access to healthcare, quality of food and drink options, access to education, and quality of the roads and transportation.\nWhile the top cities get plenty of attention every year (Vienna overtook Melbourne for the top spot in 2018), we decided to focus on the cities that have \nbeen climbing the rankings\n over the past decade. What has caused such significant improvements in these places, and what do residents have to say about their city becoming more ‘liveable’ than ever?\nHonolulu, United States\nHawaii’s capital has seen huge jumps in liveability in the past 10 years – and now ranks as the most liveable city in the United States due to its high scores in education and culture. Residents say the improvements can be attributed to the growth of the global economy and a focus on developing a more urban lifestyle that hasn’t traditionally existed in Hawaii.\n“There was finally a recognition by the government, businesses and the public that an urban core needed to be developed,” said Todd Apo, who has always lived in Hawaii and is senior vice president of community development for real estate company \nThe Howard Hughes Corporation\n. “In an isolated island destination, you have to have all the pieces of the puzzle in the right place, and it’s been a long-term effort by a lot of people to get us to this place.”\nAs part of these initiatives, Honolulu has built out walkable communities, like \nWard Village\n, which combine retail and residential spaces, and has invested heavily in the \nHART rail system\n, Honolulu’s first rail system, which is set to be operational by 2020 and will eventually run from downtown Honolulu to Kualaka‘i, 20 miles west.\nWith expats moving here from around the world, especially from Japan and other Asian countries, Honolulu is its own melting pot that welcomes all people and traditions. “Everyone's in the same canoe to make sure everyone's experience in coming here and living here is very peaceful and enjoyable,” said Simon Treacy, Hawaii president of The Howard Hughes Corporation, who recently moved from New York. “Honolulu [has] got a beautiful culture; it's got this \nAloha spirit\n; it's got all the elements of a city, of a community, of an environment that's inspiring yet very refreshing and healthy.”\nBudapest, Hungary\nHungary’s largest and capital city has made improvements in infrastructure and neighbourhood development in the past 10 years, and residents have noticed.\n“I’ve lived in Budapest for eight years, and the city has made huge progress,” said Wiktoria Skiba, founder of Budapest magazine \nThe Spoiled Queen\n. “There are way more cycling paths and better 24-hour buses and trams, and many parts of the city have been revitalised, like the VIII district which was always less developed.”\nThough Hungary has been a wine-growing region since the 5th Century, its craft beer scene is now exploding, along with a new wave of street food and coffee shops. The revitalisation has also come with an uptick in international companies moving in, looking to secure an EU presence while also paying more affordable wages. This has led to an increase in job opportunities for expats who don’t speak Hungarian.\nThe growth hasn’t all been good, however. “Due to many cheap bars that have opened recently, especially in district VIII, this part of the city [has] become overcrowded and filled with tourists,” Skiba said, noting that the uptick in tourists and expats have caused rental costs to rise. “Expats who are planning to move to Budapest should check the rental cost on various Facebook groups, which are run by locals and by expats, to make sure they pay fair prices and not higher ones just because they are foreigners, which frequently happens here,” she said.\nKuwait City, Kuwait\nWhile Kuwait City ranks in the middle of the pack when it comes to liveability, the city continues to make strides in its score by becoming more culturally open and making massive improvements in its highway system. Nestled between Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the Persian Gulf, Kuwait City has long been an important port for international trade, and that global influence has begun to appear in everyday life here.\n<!--\r\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-3135658776052410\";\r\n/* mingshi */\r\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"4998228531\";\r\ngoogle_ad_width = 336;\r\ngoogle_ad_height = 280;\r\n//-->\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n“Growing up there was a lot more stricter and tighter rules about music in public, and theatre and cinema, and all that is changing,” said Aaqib Usman, founder of multimedia company \nMidwest Immersive\n, who grew up in Kuwait and now lives in the US. “While I was growing up, [popular music] concerts were virtually unheard of. The first concert I ever attended in my life was in India, not even in Kuwait. Now there's a lot more concerts happening over there, and that's surprises me. And that's happened over the past five years.”\nUsman attributes the change to globalisation and internet culture, which has also driven a surprisingly robust interest in international cuisine. “Because alcohol is prohibited, people look to restaurants as entertainment, and they want to try every franchise in the world,” he said. “The Cheesecake Factory wasn't interested in expanding out to Kuwait, but then a Kuwaiti company decided to invest in the Cheesecake Factory just to bring the franchise over there.”\nEven though Kuwait has become more global than ever, with \nfinancial freedom\n and \nlife expectancy\n reaching record highs, expats should still be aware of challenges to living there long-term. Only Kuwaitis can own land, and foreigners who want to start a business must have a Kuwaiti partner who owns 51% of the business. With no sales tax or income tax, however, it can be a great place to work and save money for a few years, Usman said.\nAuckland, New Zealand\nConsistently a frontrunner in global liveability scores, New Zealand’s northern city has seen its liveability score inch up over the past decade. With especially high scores in the culture category, residents have noticed the difference.\n“Auckland is culturally rich, and continues to get better,” said Auckland native Christopher Hill, consultant for family travel agency \nHands Up Holidays\n. The influence of the indigenous Pasifika culture, Asian and Western cultures – and even South American cultures more recently – has led to an explosion of diverse restaurants and more cultural festivals than ever before, including Chinese New Year and Diwali.\nAuckland also has made gains in healthcare and education in recent years, though Hill says private schooling and privately funded healthcare generally show better outcomes than their public offerings. Tertiary education (universities and trade schools), however, remains “first-class”.\nThe city still has room to improve, however, especially when it comes to infrastructure. “Auckland is a sprawling city that was poorly planned, but the powers that be are working hard to improve the traffic jams, and public transportation has continued to improve,” Hill said.\nThis means that residents should think strategically when it comes to where they want to live. “Places near the beaches tend to have the worst traffic, so decide if your priority is ease of access to work or lifestyle,” Hill said. “Though if you work in the city, the ferry from Devonport [a trendy village on the north side of the bay] does enable you to have the best of both worlds.”\nLiving anywhere in Auckland won’t come cheap however. The city was recently ranked the fourth most unaffordable housing market in the world, and the government is taking steps \nto ban foreigners from buying existing properties\n.\nTaipei, Taiwan\nThis East Asian hub continues to move up the liveability rankings, particularly as the municipality continues to invest in infrastructure and healthcare. The Metro extends to almost every area of the city, including to the well-connected international airport. Residents also have glowing things to say about the healthcare and education available here – even to expats.\n“The healthcare system is amazing – and coming from a Canadian with universal healthcare, that means something!” said corporate advisor Shannon Watson, originally from Ottawa. “As an expat, we can receive a health card with equal coverage to citizens once we become an ‘alien resident’ (through work, family or school). The health card covers seeing Western or Chinese Medicine doctors, as well as dentists, and usually includes the medicine and treatment for a very small fee.”\nFamilies love the varied education opportunities available here as well. Judy Tsuei, who is originally from the US, and founder of media consultancy \nWild Hearted Words\n, found a Montessori school for her daughter, which also provides meals for students and teaches Mandarin. The whole community also looks out for children, making Taiwan ideal for young families. “You can be on a fully crowded train, and people will give up their seats if they see a child,” Tsuei said.\nThough some level of Mandarin is important to get most jobs here, residents are friendly and eager to help foreigners, even when there is a language barrier, said Tsuei.\n无论身处世界何处，探索一座新城市可以是一件有挑战性的事。但有些城市要比其它城市宜居得多。\n每年，经济学人智库（The Economist Intelligence Unit）都会按照30多个宜居标准对全世界近140座大城市进行打分，评选出世界“最宜居城市”，衡量指标包括治安、医疗资源、食品和饮水质量、教育普及程度、道路及交通质量等。\n每年，那些排名最高的城市会得到许多关注（2018年，维也纳超越墨尔本位居榜首），但我们决定考察那些过去十年中排名不断上升的城市。是什么让这些城市有了如此大的改善，这些城市的居民又是如何看待他们的城市变得比以往更“宜居”的呢？\n\r\n\n\r\n                    根据经济学人智库的评选，维也纳（图）超越墨尔本，问鼎全球最宜居城市。\r\n                \n在过去的10年中，夏威夷州首府檀香山的宜居程度得到巨大飞跃，教育和文化的得分很高，现已成为美国最宜居的城市。居民认为，如此大的进步得益于全球经济增长，以及城市化生活方式的推广，这在夏威夷当地传统中是没有的。\n阿波（Todd Apo）一直住在夏威夷，现任房地产公司霍华德·修斯公司（The Howard Hughes Corporation）社区发展部高级副总裁。他表示：“政府、企业和公众终于意识到需要开发城市的核心区域。在一个偏僻的岛屿上，你必须恰当地处理好每一件事情。很多人付出了长期的努力，我们才取得了现在的成果。”\n檀香山政府的多项举措之一，就是修建了像沃德村（Ward Village）这样适宜步行、集零售和住宅空间于一体的社区。此外，檀香山政府还对该市首个铁路系统——檀香山快速交通公司（HART）大量投资。该系统计划于2020年投入运营，最终将连接檀香山市中心和西面20英里处的夸拉凯伊（Kualaka'i）。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    在过去的几十年中，发展适宜步行的社区的让檀香山变得更宜居。\r\n                \n随着各国侨民、尤其是日本和其它亚洲国家的侨民移居至此，檀香山成为了一个大熔炉，对所有人张开双臂，包容他们的传统习俗。霍华德·修斯公司夏威夷地区主席特雷西（Simon Treacy）最近从纽约搬来檀香山，他说：“这个社群确保了每一个人来到这里、住下来都感到很平静、很享受。檀香山有着优美的文化，有欢愉的精神（Aloha spirit），有着一个城市、一个社区、一个环境所有的元素，鼓舞人心的同时又让人充满活力、身心健康。”\n布达佩斯是匈牙利首都，也是该国最大的城市，基础设施和社区发展都在过去的10年得到了提升，居民也注意到了这些改善。\n布达佩斯杂志《被宠坏的女皇》（The Spoiled Queen）创刊人斯奇巴（Wiktoria Skiba）表示：“我在布达佩斯居住了八年，这座城市真的有了很大的改善，现在有越来越多的自行车道，全天营运的公共汽车和电车也变得更好。这座城市的许多地方都重新焕发生机，比如以前一直发展欠佳的第七区也兴旺起来了。”\n匈牙利自5世纪以来一直是红酒产区，但现在该国的精酿啤酒业也在经历爆炸式发展，新开的街头美食店和咖啡厅也是随处可见。随着城市重现活力，越来越多的国际公司也入驻该地区，需负担相对较低的人力成本就能确保在欧盟市场占有一席之地。这为许多不会说匈牙利语的外籍人士提供了更多的工作机会。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    布达佩斯的许多社区已经重获新生，新开了许多酒吧和咖啡厅。\r\n                \n然而，并不是所有的增长都是好事。斯奇巴注意到，随着游客和外籍侨民越来越多，房租也开始上涨。她说：“最近开了太多家廉价酒吧，尤其是第七区。现在这一片已经变得过于拥挤，到处都是游客。计划搬到布达佩斯的外籍人士应该在本地人和外国人的不同脸书（Facebook）小组上查看房屋租金，确保自己租的房子价格合理，不会因为他们是外国人价格就更高。这种事在这里时常发生。”\n虽然科威特城宜居程度只排名中等，但得分不断攀升，是因为这里文化变得更加开放，高速公路系统也有非常巨大的改善。科威特城坐落在沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克和波斯湾中间，长久以来都是重要的国际贸易港口，城市里的日常生活也开始受到国际化的影响。\n多媒体公司“沉浸中西部”（Midwest Immersive）的创始人阿奇布·乌斯曼（Aaqib Usman）在科威特长大，现居美国。他表示：“我小的时候，科威特对公众场所播放的音乐、剧场、电影院都有更为严格的管制，现在一切都在发生变化。那个时候，流行音乐会几乎是闻所未闻的。我人生中第一场音乐会甚至不是在科威特听的，而是在印度。现在那里有越来越多的音乐会了，而且这是在过去五年间发生的，让人感到意外。”\n\r\n\n\r\n                    科威特城一直是全球贸易的重要港口，其日常生活已经开始受到国际化的影响。\r\n                \n乌斯曼认为，是全球化和网络文化带来了这些变化，而且有意思的是，这也让人们对全球的美食产生了极大兴趣。他说：“科威特禁酒，所以人们就将餐厅作为娱乐，而且他们想要尝试世界各地每一家品牌餐厅。芝士蛋糕工厂（Cheesecake Factory）当时并没有兴趣进入科威特市场，但随后一家科威特公司决定向芝士蛋糕工厂注资，为的就是引进这家餐厅。”\n虽然科威特全球化程度比以往任何时期都要高，经济自由度和居民寿命都达到历史新高，但外籍人士还是应该了解在此长期生活的困难。只有科威特人可以拥有该国土地，想要开公司的外国人必须有一个占股51%的科威特籍合伙人。乌斯曼表示，不过科威特并没有销售税或所得税，在这里工作几年存些钱还是个不错的选择。\n奥克兰\n（\n新西兰\n）\n奥克兰位于新西兰北部，全球宜居指数一直很高，过去几十年稳步上升。奥克兰在文化方面得分特别高，当地居民也注意到了这方面的进步。\n奥克兰本地人希尔（Christopher Hill）是家庭旅游中介\"举手假期\"（Hands Up Holidays）的咨询顾问。他认为：“奥克兰是一个文化底蕴深厚的城市，而且还不断发展，越变越好。”受本土大西洋文化、亚洲文化、西方文化、甚至近期的南美文化的影响，奥克兰现在涌现了各式餐馆和包括中国春节和印度的排灯节在内的各种文化节庆，数量前所未有。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    奥克兰因交通繁忙而闻名，但其基础设施在持续改善。\r\n                \n奥克兰近些年还在医疗健康和教育领域有所进步，不过希尔表示，私立学校、私立医疗总体比公立的进步更大。高等教育（大学和高等职业院校）处于“一流水平”。\n然而，这座城市还有进步的空间，尤其是在基础设施方面。希尔说：“奥克兰是个杂乱铺展的城市，规划很差。不过奥克兰正在努力改善拥堵情况，城市的公共交通也在不断提升。”\n这意味着居民应该有规划地思考自己想住在哪。希尔表示：“海滩附近通常交通状况最差，所以你要决定最重要的是上班方便还是生活有格调。不过如果你在市区上班，北岸的洋气小城德文波特（Devonport）的轮渡能让你两者兼得。”\n但住在奥克兰的任何一个地方都不便宜。该市最近被评为全世界房价第四贵的城市，市政府也在采取措施禁止外国人购买二手房产。\n台北\n（\n台湾\n）\n\r\n\n\r\n                    台北捷运几乎延伸至城市的每一个角落，居民出行便利。\r\n                \n东亚枢纽台北的宜居程度一直在提升，市政府对基础建设和医疗的持续投入是原因之一。捷运几乎延伸至城市的每一个角落，包括连接全球的国际机场。台北居民也对这里的医疗和教育大加赞赏——即便是外籍居民，待遇也并不差。\n企业咨询师华森（Shannon Watson）来自加拿大渥太华，她表示：“这里的医疗系统太棒了——作为一个享有全球医保的加拿大人，这意义重大！外籍人士会收到一张健保卡，一旦我们（通过工作、家庭或学校的关系）登记成为'外籍居民'，就享有和普通市民一样的医疗服务。你可以拿着这张卡去看西医和中医，还可以看牙，通常只用花很少的钱就可以拿药、接受治疗。”\n许多家庭也喜欢这里多样化的教育资源。崔女士（Judy Tsuei）来自美国，是媒体咨询公司不羁文字（Wild Hearted Words）的创始人。她为自己的女儿找到了一所蒙特梭利（Montessori）学校，该校提供午餐，而且教中文。整个社区都很关心儿童，这让台湾成为了许多年轻家庭的理想之选。崔女士表示：“即使在拥挤的车厢里，人们都会给小孩让座。”\n崔女士还指出，虽然这里的大部分工作都要求要会一定的中文，但即便存在语言障碍，居民们都非常愿意对外国人伸出援手，十分友善。\n\r\n\r\r\n\n\r\n\nNavigating a new place can be challenging no matter where in the world it is, but certain cities make day-to-day living a lot easier than others.\nThese ‘most liveable cities’ are ranked every year by The \nEconomist Intelligence Unit\n, which rounds up 140 of the world’s biggest cities and ranks each one according to more than 30 factors that influence liveability, including safety, access to healthcare, quality of food and drink options, access to education, and quality of the roads and transportation.\n\r\n\nWhile the top cities get plenty of attention every year (Vienna overtook Melbourne for the top spot in 2018), we decided to focus on the cities that have \nbeen climbing the rankings\n over the past decade.

The whole community also looks out for children, making Taiwan ideal for young families. “You can be on a fully crowded train, and people will give up their seats if they see a child,” Tsuei said.\nThough some level of Mandarin is important to get most jobs here, residents are friendly and eager to help foreigners, even when there is a language barrier, said Tsuei.\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n无论身处世界何处，探索一座新城市可以是一件有挑战性的事。但有些城市要比其它城市宜居得多。\n\r\n\n每年，经济学人智库（The Economist Intelligence Unit）都会按照30多个宜居标准对全世界近140座大城市进行打分，评选出世界“最宜居城市”，衡量指标包括治安、医疗资源、食品和饮水质量、教育普及程度、道路及交通质量等。\n每年，那些排名最高的城市会得到许多关注（2018年，维也纳超越墨尔本位居榜首），但我们决定考察那些过去十年中排名不断上升的城市。是什么让这些城市有了如此大的改善，这些城市的居民又是如何看待他们的城市变得比以往更“宜居”的呢？\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    根据经济学人智库的评选，维也纳（图）超越墨尔本，问鼎全球最宜居城市。\r\n                \n檀香山（美国）\n在过去的10年中，夏威夷州首府檀香山的宜居程度得到巨大飞跃，教育和文化的得分很高，现已成为美国最宜居的城市。居民认为，如此大的进步得益于全球经济增长，以及城市化生活方式的推广，这在夏威夷当地传统中是没有的。\n阿波（Todd Apo）一直住在夏威夷，现任房地产公司霍华德·修斯公司（The Howard Hughes Corporation）社区发展部高级副总裁。他表示：“政府、企业和公众终于意识到需要开发城市的核心区域。在一个偏僻的岛屿上，你必须恰当地处理好每一件事情。很多人付出了长期的努力，我们才取得了现在的成果。”\n檀香山政府的多项举措之一，就是修建了像沃德村（Ward Village）这样适宜步行、集零售和住宅空间于一体的社区。此外，檀香山政府还对该市首个铁路系统——檀香山快速交通公司（HART）大量投资。该系统计划于2020年投入运营，最终将连接檀香山市中心和西面20英里处的夸拉凯伊（Kualaka'i）。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    在过去的几十年中，发展适宜步行的社区的让檀香山变得更宜居。\r\n                \n随着各国侨民、尤其是日本和其它亚洲国家的侨民移居至此，檀香山成为了一个大熔炉，对所有人张开双臂，包容他们的传统习俗。霍华德·修斯公司夏威夷地区主席特雷西（Simon Treacy）最近从纽约搬来檀香山，他说：“这个社群确保了每一个人来到这里、住下来都感到很平静、很享受。檀香山有着优美的文化，有欢愉的精神（Aloha spirit），有着一个城市、一个社区、一个环境所有的元素，鼓舞人心的同时又让人充满活力、身心健康。”\n布达佩斯（匈牙利）\n布达佩斯是匈牙利首都，也是该国最大的城市，基础设施和社区发展都在过去的10年得到了提升，居民也注意到了这些改善。\n布达佩斯杂志《被宠坏的女皇》（The Spoiled Queen）创刊人斯奇巴（Wiktoria Skiba）表示：“我在布达佩斯居住了八年，这座城市真的有了很大的改善，现在有越来越多的自行车道，全天营运的公共汽车和电车也变得更好。这座城市的许多地方都重新焕发生机，比如以前一直发展欠佳的第七区也兴旺起来了。”\n匈牙利自5世纪以来一直是红酒产区，但现在该国的精酿啤酒业也在经历爆炸式发展，新开的街头美食店和咖啡厅也是随处可见。随着城市重现活力，越来越多的国际公司也入驻该地区，需负担相对较低的人力成本就能确保在欧盟市场占有一席之地。这为许多不会说匈牙利语的外籍人士提供了更多的工作机会。\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    布达佩斯的许多社区已经重获新生，新开了许多酒吧和咖啡厅。\r\n                \n然而，并不是所有的增长都是好事。斯奇巴注意到，随着游客和外籍侨民越来越多，房租也开始上涨。她说：“最近开了太多家廉价酒吧，尤其是第七区。现在这一片已经变得过于拥挤，到处都是游客。计划搬到布达佩斯的外籍人士应该在本地人和外国人的不同脸书（Facebook）小组上查看房屋租金，确保自己租的房子价格合理，不会因为他们是外国人价格就更高。这种事在这里时常发生。”\n科威特城（科威特）\n虽然科威特城宜居程度只排名中等，但得分不断攀升，是因为这里文化变得更加开放，高速公路系统也有非常巨大的改善。科威特城坐落在沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克和波斯湾中间，长久以来都是重要的国际贸易港口，城市里的日常生活也开始受到国际化的影响。\n多媒体公司“沉浸中西部”（Midwest Immersive）的创始人阿奇布·乌斯曼（Aaqib Usman）在科威特长大，现居美国。他表示：“我小的时候，科威特对公众场所播放的音乐、剧场、电影院都有更为严格的管制，现在一切都在发生变化。那个时候，流行音乐会几乎是闻所未闻的。我人生中第一场音乐会甚至不是在科威特听的，而是在印度。现在那里有越来越多的音乐会了，而且这是在过去五年间发生的，让人感到意外。”\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    科威特城一直是全球贸易的重要港口，其日常生活已经开始受到国际化的影响。\r\n                \n乌斯曼认为，是全球化和网络文化带来了这些变化，而且有意思的是，这也让人们对全球的美食产生了极大兴趣。他说：“科威特禁酒，所以人们就将餐厅作为娱乐，而且他们想要尝试世界各地每一家品牌餐厅。芝士蛋糕工厂（Cheesecake Factory）当时并没有兴趣进入科威特市场，但随后一家科威特公司决定向芝士蛋糕工厂注资，为的就是引进这家餐厅。”\n虽然科威特全球化程度比以往任何时期都要高，经济自由度和居民寿命都达到历史新高，但外籍人士还是应该了解在此长期生活的困难。只有科威特人可以拥有该国土地，想要开公司的外国人必须有一个占股51%的科威特籍合伙人。乌斯曼表示，不过科威特并没有销售税或所得税，在这里工作几年存些钱还是个不错的选择。\n奥克兰\n（\n新西兰\n）\n奥克兰位于新西兰北部，全球宜居指数一直很高，过去几十年稳步上升。奥克兰在文化方面得分特别高，当地居民也注意到了这方面的进步。\n奥克兰本地人希尔（Christopher Hill）是家庭旅游中介\"举手假期\"（Hands Up Holidays）的咨询顾问。他认为：“奥克兰是一个文化底蕴深厚的城市，而且还不断发展，越变越好。”受本土大西洋文化、亚洲文化、西方文化、甚至近期的南美文化的影响，奥克兰现在涌现了各式餐馆和包括中国春节和印度的排灯节在内的各种文化节庆，数量前所未有。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    奥克兰因交通繁忙而闻名，但其基础设施在持续改善。\r\n                \n奥克兰近些年还在医疗健康和教育领域有所进步，不过希尔表示，私立学校、私立医疗总体比公立的进步更大。高等教育（大学和高等职业院校）处于“一流水平”。\n然而，这座城市还有进步的空间，尤其是在基础设施方面。希尔说：“奥克兰是个杂乱铺展的城市，规划很差。不过奥克兰正在努力改善拥堵情况，城市的公共交通也在不断提升。”\n这意味着居民应该有规划地思考自己想住在哪。希尔表示：“海滩附近通常交通状况最差，所以你要决定最重要的是上班方便还是生活有格调。不过如果你在市区上班，北岸的洋气小城德文波特（Devonport）的轮渡能让你两者兼得。”\n但住在奥克兰的任何一个地方都不便宜。该市最近被评为全世界房价第四贵的城市，市政府也在采取措施禁止外国人购买二手房产。\n台北\n（\n台湾\n）\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    台北捷运几乎延伸至城市的每一个角落，居民出行便利。\r\n                \n东亚枢纽台北的宜居程度一直在提升，市政府对基础建设和医疗的持续投入是原因之一。捷运几乎延伸至城市的每一个角落，包括连接全球的国际机场。台北居民也对这里的医疗和教育大加赞赏——即便是外籍居民，待遇也并不差。\n企业咨询师华森（Shannon Watson）来自加拿大渥太华，她表示：“这里的医疗系统太棒了——作为一个享有全球医保的加拿大人，这意义重大！外籍人士会收到一张健保卡，一旦我们（通过工作、家庭或学校的关系）登记成为'外籍居民'，就享有和普通市民一样的医疗服务。你可以拿着这张卡去看西医和中医，还可以看牙，通常只用花很少的钱就可以拿药、接受治疗。”\n许多家庭也喜欢这里多样化的教育资源。崔女士（Judy Tsuei）来自美国，是媒体咨询公司不羁文字（Wild Hearted Words）的创始人。她为自己的女儿找到了一所蒙特梭利（Montessori）学校，该校提供午餐，而且教中文。整个社区都很关心儿童，这让台湾成为了许多年轻家庭的理想之选。崔女士表示：“即使在拥挤的车厢里，人们都会给小孩让座。”\n崔女士还指出，虽然这里的大部分工作都要求要会一定的中文，但即便存在语言障碍，居民们都非常愿意对外国人伸出援手，十分友善。\n\r\n\r\n"
