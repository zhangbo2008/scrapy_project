Some people are searching in all corners of the earth for their soulmate but come back in vain. One of the reasons of that failure is that the bachelor did not ask himself. So the, before loving someone, before making your choice on the right guy or girl to marry, start by asking yourself the real questions: who are you? What do you want? What are you expecting from your partner? What do you like most? All these little questions may seem tiny but are very important. It is after answering these questions to yourself that you can start defining who you are and what you really want.\nBe positive and keep smiling\nAfter knowing yourself, you can now begin to change your mind. The next key for alluring your future wife or husband is being positive. By being positive, people will automatically call on you, run to you and would like to by your side because of the energy you are spreading all around you. Don’t worry, it’s metaphysical. Keep smiling, not in blissful ignorance but the acceptation of the reality: that you are what you are, good-looking and valuable. These two steps are more than essential. It is all in the attitude.\nWhat do you want?\nThere is no formula in love. You may already know the type of guy/girl you would like to date and that is correct. You find your love and that is all. If you have not yet defined clearly what kind of person you want to be your husband or wife, do not worry. These are things that have to be discovered solely and patiently. The person may not be what you have been expecting, but if there is love, communication can begin.\nCommon interest\nThe proverb says that birds of the feather lock together. This may be true in some cases but generally speaking, the two individuals need a common interest. It may be playing video games or horse riding. It doesn’t matter; you just have to be sure that there is, at least, two things that you like to do with the other person. This will play a big role in the couple’s future life together.\nCan you communicate to each other?\nThis is another key point. Two persons who cannot talk to each other just cannot live together. For a period of time, it can be possible but for a long-term relationship, it does not work. The two peoples have to share their feelings (happiness, likes and dislikes, anger, etc.) to each one other. And once again, we repeat it: communication is the basis of a long-term and happy marriage.\nThese are just few tips but the decision is yours. Be who you are, be positive, define what you want and what you do not want and finally choose someone that you can talk with and who has a common interest with you.\n 查看译文\n认识你自己\n如果你想选择一位合适的伴侣，认识你自己这一步相当重要。你必须认识自己。一些人翻遍地球寻找自己的灵魂伴侣，但徒手而归。失败的一个原因便是单身人士没有反求诸己。因此，在与某人陷入爱河之前，在你选择合适的人结婚之前，先要问自己最真实的几个问题：你是谁？你想要什么？你对伴侣的期待是什么？你最喜欢什么？所有这些问题似乎微小，但却重要。只有在回答了这些问题后你才能开始定义自己的身份和欲求。\n积极并且保持微笑\n在认识自己后，你现在可以开始改变自己的思维。吸引未来伴侣的第二个重要因素便是要积极。若是积极，人们自动就会与你交谈，和你往来，愿意支持你，这都是因为你将自己的能量传递给四周的人。不要担心，这只是形而上学。保持微笑，并不是乐而忘忧地愚昧，而是接受现实：你就是你自己，美丽且有价值。这两步都是核心。一切取决于态度。\n你想要什么？\n爱情里没有公式可套。你也许已经知道你想要约会的对象的类型。你找到了你的真爱，这就行了。如果你还没有明确你想要哪种伴侣，别担心。这些需要独自有耐心地发现。这人也许不是你期待的，但是只要有爱，就会有沟通。\n共同爱好\n常言道，物以类聚，人以群分。在一些情况下也许是有理，但通常来说，两个个体需要一个共同爱好。这也许是玩电游或骑马。这没关系；你只需要确定至少你和另一个人有喜欢做的两件事。这在未来两人的生活中将扮演重要角色。\n你们能相互交流吗？\n还有一点很重要。不能相互交流的两人无法生活在一起。在一段时间内，两人也许能在一起，但这不是长久之计。两人必须分享自己的感情（幸福，喜好，厌烦之事，愤怒，等等）我们要再一次强调：一个长久幸福的婚姻需要交流作为基础。\n这些只是小建议，决定权还是在你手中。做你自己，积极，明确自己的欲求和所摒弃之事，最后选择一个与你有共同爱好能与之交流的人。"
