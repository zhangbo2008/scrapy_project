That’s a measure of sweet justice.\r\n\n\r\n星期二晚上在华盛顿举行的民主党国会竞选委员会会议上，人们对选举结果做出反应。 \n\r\n因此，一位对女性报以粗俗不敬言辞的总统，将会和更多的女性立法者打交道。这可以说是还了一个公道。\r\n\nMany of the candidates for the House who turned red seats blue were people of color. I think of Antonio Delgado in New York, whose blackness was something that Republicans dwelled on. I think of Colin Allred in Texas, who defeated a previously invincible Republican, Pete Sessions, who has been in Congress for two decades. I think of Lauren Underwood in Illinois, who was making her first bid for political office and wasn’t initially given much of a chance. She proved the naysayers wrong.\r\n\n众议院很多取代了共和党的民主党候选人是有色人种。我想起纽约的安东尼奥·德尔加多(Antonio Delgado)，他的黑皮肤是共和党人的肉中刺。我想起了德克萨斯州的科林·奥尔雷德(Colin Allred)，他击败了曾经在国会20年，此前从未失败的共和党人皮特·塞申斯(Pete Sessions)。我想起伊利诺伊州的劳伦·安德伍德(Lauren Underwood)，她第一次竞选政治职位，一开始并没有获得太多机会。她证明否定者是错的。\r\n\nAllred and Underwood are in their 30s, which speaks to another theme in the Democratic takeover of House: the number of young candidates behind it. Nancy Pelosi, 78, may be poised for a new stint as the Speaker of the House, but what happened among Democratic candidates throughout the country on Tuesday represented a changing of the guard and a diversifying of the ranks.\r\n\n奥尔雷德和安德伍德都是30多岁，这与民主党接管众议院的另一个主题有关：其背后的年轻候选人数量。有望担任众议院议长一职的也许是78岁的南希·佩洛西(Nancy Pelosi)，但是周二全国民主党候选人的情况，代表了一次主导势力的转变，以及群体的多元化。\r\n\nIn a bellwether House race in Kansas, Sharice Davids defeated the Republican incumbent, Kevin Yoder. She’s 38, openly gay and will be one of the first Native American woman in Congress. The other, also elected on Tuesday, is Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat.\r\n\n在堪萨斯州的众议员竞选中，沙丽斯·戴维斯(Sharice Davids)击败了共和党现任议员凯文·约德(Kevin Yoder)。戴维斯38岁，是公开的同性恋者，她将成为美国历史上头两位美洲原住民女性议员之一。另一位也是在周二当选，是新墨西哥州的民主党人黛比·哈兰德(Deb Haaland)。\r\n\nAh, Kansas: Trump won the state in 2016 by more than 20 points, but on Tuesday, in the governor’s race there, Kansans rejected a far-right candidate who was a darling of the president’s — Kris Kobach — for a Democratic woman, Laura Kelly.\r\n\n啊，堪萨斯：特朗普在2016年以超过20点赢下了这个州，但是周二，在那里的州长竞选中，堪萨斯拒绝了一名极右翼候选人、深得总统青睐的克里斯·科巴赫(Kris Kobach)，选择女民主党人劳拉·凯利(Laura Kelly)作州长。\r\n\nShe won handily, and Democrats picked up other governorships that had belonged to Republicans, for instance in Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, where Scott Walker was denied a third term. Democrats will now govern all three states — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — that handed Trump his margin of victory in the Electoral College.\r\n\n她胜得很轻松，民主党人还从共和党人手中赢下了其他州长职位，例如在密歇根州、伊利诺伊州和威斯康星州，在威斯康星州，斯科特·沃尔克(Scott Walker)未能获得第三个任期。民主党现在手握密歇根州、威斯康星州和宾夕法尼亚州——正是这三个州，令特朗普在选举人团投票中险胜。\r\n\nI can look at the way Trump has governed — unabashedly spreading hate, gleefully shattering norms and sowing chaos at every turn — and wonder why more didn’t go Democrats’ way on Tuesday. I can tally their possible mistakes. Too many Democrats still haven’t figured out the difference between talking to and talking down to Americans, and too many engage in a kind of oppression Olympics that turns off voters in the middle.\r\n\n看着特朗普的治理方式——毫不掩饰地传播仇恨，兴高采烈地破坏规范，并一有机会就播下混乱——我想知道为什么周二没有更多人倒向民主党。我可以罗列他们可能犯的错误。太多的民主党人仍然没有弄清楚同美国人谈话与居高临下同美国人谈话之间的区别，太多的人在变着法地进行压制，让那些不左不右的选民不爽。\r\n\nBut on Tuesday, in House elections, Democrats prevailed among independents. They prevailed in suburbs. They prevailed in swing districts with candidates who showed plenty of prudent moderation.\r\n\n但在周二的众议院选举中，民主党人在争取中间派方面占了上风。他们在郊区占了上风。他们在摇摆区占了上风，在那里，候选人表现出足够谨慎的态度。\r\n\nAnd they prevailed despite low unemployment numbers, wage growth and an overall economic picture that most Americans find positive. It wasn’t “the economy, stupid” that drove what happened on Tuesday. It was Trump.\r\n\n尽管失业率低、工资增长以及大多数美国人认为良好的整体经济形势，他们仍然占了上风。推动周二发生的事情的，不是“经济，蠢货”。而是特朗普。\r\n\nHe repeatedly told his supporters in the days leading up to the midterms that he was essentially on the ballot, and for once he wasn’t boasting idly. Americans weighed in on him, and if it wasn’t quite the spanking he had coming, it certainly wasn’t a hug.\r\n\n在中期选举前几天，他一再告诉他的支持者，他的名字基本上也是在选票上的，而这一次，他不是信口开河。美国人对他进行了评估，其结果就算不是在打他的屁股，至少也谈不上是一次拥抱。\r\n\n弗兰克·布鲁尼(Frank Bruni)自1995年以来一直在《纽约时报》工作。他在2011年成为专栏作家之前，曾任白宫记者、罗马分社社长和首席餐厅评论家。他是三本畅销书的作者。欢迎在Twitter @FrankBruni和Facebook上关注他。\r\n\r\n\n翻译：晋其角\r\n"
