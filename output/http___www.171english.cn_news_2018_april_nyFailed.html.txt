"They Tried to Boycott Facebook, Apple and Google. They Failed.\r\nSAN FRANCISCO 鈥� Ryan Knight, a Democratic activist in Los Angeles, called for a boycott of Apple in February because it hadn鈥檛 responded to calls to delete a channel from the National Rifle Association from its streaming-video service after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淒ear @Apple,鈥� Mr. Knight wrote on Twitter. 鈥淵our silence is deafening. #BoycottApple.鈥� More than 330 accounts retweeted the message.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did Mr. Knight post the message? He used an iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the reach and influence of Silicon Valley鈥檚 tech giants have increased, so have the calls to boycott their products and services. The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy: The tech companies鈥� products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat issue was crystallized in recent weeks with Facebook. Hundreds of people deleted their accounts after revelations that the political-data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. Yet many of those same people promptly instructed their friends to find them on Instagram, which is owned by 鈥� you guessed it 鈥� Facebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚t鈥檚 exactly the same company. I realize it鈥檚 ridiculous,鈥� said Sachi Cunningham, a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram, where, she said, the conversation is less toxic.\r\n\r\n\r\nMs. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. 鈥淚 don鈥檛 know if I can get out of the ecosystem,鈥� she said.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company鈥檚 diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google鈥檚 Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: 鈥淕oogle鈥檚 firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.鈥� The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven Breitbart is running into the same dilemma. The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices 鈥� and it said it would livestream the discussion on Facebook. Breitbart didn鈥檛 respond to a request for comment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic 鈥� and spent a few dollars more 鈥� at a nearby Target.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. 鈥淚 completely forgot that they鈥檙e owned by Amazon,鈥� she said.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople used the hashtag #March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media. An analysis of about 58,500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad, according to Keyhole. Those included popular tweets using the #March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淗ad I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,鈥� Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. 鈥淲e are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚 do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple鈥檚, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?鈥� Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview.\r\n\r\n\r\nEddy Cue, a senior executive at Apple, recently said that the NRA channel didn鈥檛 violate the company鈥檚 policies. Facebook, Google and Amazon didn鈥檛 respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company鈥檚 orbit, not only with Instagram but also with the company鈥檚 popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cher recently deleted her Facebook page, she said on Twitter, 鈥�2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me.鈥� But her Instagram account, with 768,000 followers, was still active.\r\n\r\n\r\nLikewise, Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, deleted the Facebook pages of both companies 鈥� but left their pages and his personal account active on Instagram. The photo-sharing platform, he said on Twitter, is fine 鈥渟o long as it stays fairly independent.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Cox, 39, a woodworker in Los Angeles, recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram. When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company, he replied, 鈥淚t鈥檚 a double-edged sword, but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nInstagram has proved an effective hedge for Facebook against people losing interest or trust in its main site. While the percentage of American adults who use Facebook has remained flat at 68 percent since 2016, according to a January survey of 2,002 American adults by the Pew Research Center, Instagram use rose to 35 percent from 28 percent over that period. Instagram is also more popular with younger people than older people, according to the survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nRayven Bruzzese, 26, a sign-language student in Philadelphia, said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time. Now she spends her time on Instagram.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook-owned service, she said her options were limited. Few of her friends are on Twitter, and many have stopped using Snapchat.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淲here am I supposed to go?鈥� she said. 鈥淚 wish there was something else.鈥�\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�2鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圝ACK NICAS锛�\r\n鏃ч噾灞扁�斺�旀礇鏉夌煻姘戜富鍏氭椿鍔ㄤ汉澹憺瀹壜峰鐗�(Ryan Knight)鍦�2鏈堝懠鍚佹姷鍒惰嫻鏋�(Apple)锛屽師鍥犳槸浣涚綏閲岃揪宸炲笗鍏嬪叞鏍″洯鏋嚮浜嬩欢鍙戠敓鍚庯紝鑻规灉娌℃湁鍥炲簲灏嗙編鍥芥鏋崗浼氾紙National Rifle Association锛岀畝绉癗RA锛夌殑棰戦亾浠庡叾娴佽棰戞湇鍔″钩鍙颁笂鍒犻櫎鐨勫懠澹般��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滀翰鐖辩殑@鑻规灉锛屸�濆鐗瑰湪Twitter涓婂啓閬撱�傗�滀綘鐨勬矇榛橀渿鑰虫鑱嬨��#BoycottApple锛�#鎶靛埗鑻规灉锛夈�傗�濊秴杩�330涓处鎴疯浆鍙戜簡杩欐潯娑堟伅銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n濂堢壒鏄�庝箞鍙戝竷杩欐潯淇℃伅鐨勫憿锛熶粬鐢ㄧ殑鏄痠Phone銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n闅忕潃纭呰胺绉戞妧宸ㄥご褰卞搷鑼冨洿鍜屽奖鍝嶅姏澧炲姞锛屾姷鍒跺畠浠殑浜у搧鍜屾湇鍔＄殑鍛煎０涔熻秺鏉ヨ秺楂樸�傞棶棰樻槸锛屽畬鍏ㄥ仛鍒板苟闈炴槗浜嬶細绉戞妧鍏徃鐨勪骇鍝侀殢澶勫彲瑙侊紝闅句互閬垮厤銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鏈�杩戝嚑鍛紝杩欎釜闂鍦‵acebook涓婂緱鍒颁簡浣撶幇銆傚湪鐖嗗嚭鏀挎不鏁版嵁鍏徃鍓戞ˉ鍒嗘瀽(Cambridge Analytica)涓嶅綋鑾峰彇5000涓嘑acebook鐢ㄦ埛鐨勪俊鎭悗锛屾垚鐧句笂鍗冪殑浜哄垹闄や簡浠栦滑鐨勮处鍙枫�備絾浠栦滑褰撲腑寰堝浜虹珛鍗宠鏈嬪弸鍒癐nstagram涓婂幓鎵捐嚜宸扁�斺�斾綘鐚滃浜嗏�斺�擨nstagram灞炰簬Facebook鏃椾笅銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滃畬鍏ㄦ槸鍚屼竴瀹跺叕鍙搞�傛垜鎰忚瘑鍒拌繖澶崚璋簡锛屸�濇棫閲戝北绾綍鐗囧埗浣滀汉钀ㄥ路鍧庡畞瀹�(Sachi Cunningham)璇淬�傚ス涓婂懆娉ㄩ攢浜嗚嚜宸辩殑Facebook锛屽苟灏嗘敞鎰忓姏杞Щ鍒颁簡Instagram涓娿�傚ス璇达紝Instagram涓婄殑瀵硅瘽涓嶈壇褰卞搷灏忎竴浜涖��\r\n\r\n\r\n璐瑰煄鎵嬭瀛︾敓闆烽洴路甯冮瞾娉藉3鏈堜唤鍒犻櫎浜嗚嚜宸辩殑璐﹀彿锛屽洜涓哄ス瑙夊緱瀹冭鑷繁蹇冪儲鎰忎贡锛岀幇鍦ㄥス鎶婃椂闂磋姳鍦ㄤ簡Instagram涓娾�斺�斿悗鑰呬篃褰扚acebook鎵�鏈�\r\n\r\n\r\n韬负銆婄航绾︽椂鎶ャ�嬭嚜鐢辨挵绋夸汉鐨勫潕瀹佸畨鎺ョ潃琛ㄧず锛屽ス寰堝揩灏卞紑濮嬫兂蹇垫妸Facebook浣滀负绾綍鐗囩爺绌跺伐鍏风殑鏃ュ瓙銆傗�滄垜涓嶇煡閬撹嚜宸辫兘涓嶈兘鎽嗚劚杩欎釜鐢熸�佺郴缁燂紝鈥濆ス璇淬��\r\n\r\n\r\n甯屾湜閫氳繃鏀惧純鍏朵骇鍝佹潵鎯╃綒澶у瀷绉戞妧鍏徃鐨勪汉锛屽父甯稿彈鍥颁簬鍦ㄦ憜鑴卞畠浠殑杩囩▼涓亣鍒扮殑鍥伴毦銆傚幓骞达紝璋锋瓕(Google)鐨勫伐绋嬪笀瑭瑰鏂疯揪鑾皵(James Damore)鍥犳姩鍑昏鍏徃鐨勫鍏冨寲琛屽姩鑰岄伃寮�闄ゅ悗锛屾暟浠ョ櫨璁＄殑浜哄湪绀句氦濯掍綋涓婂懠鍚佹姷鍒惰胺姝屻�備絾鎹ぞ浜ゅ獟浣撶爺绌跺叕鍙窴eyhole瀵�8鏈堜互鏉ヨ繎7000鏉′娇鐢�#BoycottGoogle锛�#鎶靛埗璋锋瓕锛夋爣绛剧殑鎺ㄦ枃杩涜鐨勫垎鏋愭樉绀猴紝26%鐨勬帹鏂囨潵鑷娇鐢ㄨ胺姝岀殑瀹夊崜(Android)杞欢鐨勮澶囥��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦�8鏈�8鏃ワ紝涓�涓悕涓虹背灏旈】路鏅浄鏂鐗�(Milton Prescott)鐨凾witter璐﹀彿鍙戞帹鏂囪锛氣�滆胺姝屽紑闄よ┕濮嗘柉路杈捐帿灏旂殑琛屼负褰诲簳璇佸疄浜嗕粬鐨勮鐐广�傛垜灏嗕笉鍐嶄娇鐢ㄨ胺姝岀殑浠讳綍鏈嶅姟銆�#BoycottGoogle銆傗�濊繖鏉℃帹鏂囨槸閫氳繃涓�鍙板畨鍗撹澶囧彂甯冪殑銆傚彂缁欒甯愬彿鐨勬秷鎭棤浜哄洖澶嶃��\r\n\r\n\r\n灏辫繛甯冭幈宸寸壒(Breitbart)涔熼亣鍒颁簡鍚屾牱鐨勯毦棰樸�傝繖瀹朵繚瀹堟淳缃戠珯璁″垝涓惧姙涓�鍦烘湁鍏冲儚Facebook杩欐牱鐨勭鎶�骞冲彴濡備綍鍘嬪埗淇濆畧娲惧０闊崇殑鐮旇浼氾紝骞惰〃绀轰細鍦‵acebook涓婄洿鎾璁烘儏鍐点�傚竷鑾卞反鐗规病鏈夊洖澶嶈鑰呯殑缃瘎璇锋眰銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n涓�瀹剁敓鍛界瀛﹀叕鍙哥殑椤圭洰缁忕悊鐜涗附钀风悊鏌ユ．(Marisa Richardson)璇达紝鍓嶄笉涔呭緱鐭ヤ簹椹�婂湪鍏舵祦瑙嗛鏈嶅姟骞冲彴涓婃彁渚汵RA棰戦亾鍚庯紝濂瑰紑濮嬫姷鍒朵簹椹�娿�傚洜姝ら渶瑕佹礂琛ｇ矇鐨勬椂鍊欙紝濂规病鏈変娇鐢ㄨ繖瀹剁數鍟嗙綉绔欙紝鑰屾槸鍕囨暍闈㈠鎷ユ尋鐨勪汉缇ゅ拰浜ら�氾紝鍘婚檮杩戜竴瀹跺鍚夌壒(Target)瓒呭競锛屽鑺卞嚑缇庡厓涔板埌浜嗕笢瑗裤��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗗嚑澶╁悗锛屽ス鍘讳簡濂瑰湪鍔犲埄绂忓凹浜氬窞濂ュ厠鍏扮殑瀹堕檮杩戠殑鍏ㄩ(Whole Foods)瓒呭競涔颁笢瑗裤�傗�滄垜瀹屽叏蹇樹簡浠栦滑涔熷睘浜庝簹椹�娿�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦�2鏈堢殑甯曞厠鍏版灙鍑讳簨浠惰繃鍚庯紝鏋敮绠″埗娲诲姩浜哄＋鍛煎悂鎶靛埗鑻规灉鍜屼簹椹�婄殑鏌愪簺鏈嶅姟锛屽洜涓轰粬浠湁NRA鐨勯閬撱��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n甯冮瞾娉藉琛ㄧず锛屽ス鐨勭ぞ浜ゅ獟浣撻�夋嫨寰堟湁闄愩�傚ス鐨勬湅鍙嬩滑鍑犱箮閮戒笉鐢═witter锛屽緢澶氫汉涔熶笉鍐嶄娇鐢⊿napchat銆�\r\n\r\n浜轰滑鐢�#March1NRABoycott锛�#3鏈�1鏃ユ姷鍒禢RA锛夌殑鏍囩锛屽湪绀句氦濯掍綋涓婂浼犺繖涓�娑堟伅銆傛嵁Keyhole瀵瑰ぇ绾�58500鏉″甫鏈夎鏍囩鐨勬帹鏂囪繘琛岀殑鍒嗘瀽鏄剧ず锛屽叾涓繎涓�鍗婃潵鑷猧Phone鎴杋Pad銆傚叾涓寘鎷コ婕斿憳鑹句附鑾幝风背鍏拌(Alyssa Milano)浣跨敤#March1NRABoycott 鏍囩鍙戣〃鐨勯偅浜涘ぇ鍙楁杩庣殑鎺ㄦ枃銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滃鏋滄垜鐢ㄥ畨鍗撴墜鏈哄彂閫佸悓鏍风殑鎺ㄦ枃锛屼篃浼氬嚭鐜板悓鏍风殑闂銆傚畨鍗撴墜鏈轰篃鏈塏RA鐢佃鍙扮殑搴旂敤绋嬪簭锛屸�濈背鎷夎閫氳繃涓�浣嶅彂瑷�浜鸿〃绀恒�傗�滄垜浠幇鍦ㄦ墠寮�濮嬬煡閬擄紝杩欎簺鍏徃涓嶄粎娓楅�忓埌浜嗘垜浠殑鎰忚瘑褰㈡�佸綋涓紝涔熶互鎴戜滑鎵�鑳芥兂璞＄殑鏈�娣卞埢鐨勬柟寮忔笚閫忓埌浜嗘垜浠殑鐢熸椿涓�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏍规嵁Keyhole鐨勬暟鎹紝鑷�8鏈堜唤浠ユ潵锛屼娇鐢�#BoycottApple鏍囩鐨�4700鏉℃帹鏂囦腑锛屾湁杩戜笁鍒嗕箣涓�鍙戣嚜iPhone銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滄垜纭疄鏈塱Phone锛屼絾浣滀负鑻规灉鍏徃鐨勫鎴凤紝鎴戝氨涓嶈兘璁╀粬浠壙鎷呰矗浠讳簡鍚楋紵鈥濈敤iPhone鍛煎悂鎶靛埗鑻规灉鐨勬椿鍔ㄤ汉澹鐗瑰湪鎺ュ彈閲囪鏃惰〃绀恒��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍓嶄笉涔咃紝鑻规灉鍏徃鐨勯珮绠¤壘杩峰簱浼�(Eddy Cue)琛ㄧず锛孨RA棰戦亾娌℃湁杩濆弽鑻规灉鍏徃鐨勬斂绛栥�侳acebook銆佽胺姝屽拰浜氶┈閫婃病鏈夊洖澶嶇疆璇勮姹傘��\r\n\r\n\r\n璁稿鏈�杩戞斁寮冧簡Facebook璐︽埛鐨勪汉浠嶅鍦ㄨ鍏徃鐨勮建閬撲箣涓紝涓嶄粎浣跨敤Instagram锛岃繕浣跨敤璇ュ叕鍙搁鍙楁杩庣殑鍗虫椂閫氳搴旂敤绋嬪簭WhatsApp鍜孧essenger銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍓嶄笉涔咃紝闆効(Cher)鍒犻櫎濂圭殑Facebook椤甸潰鏃跺湪Twitter涓婅锛氣�滆繖涓ゅぉ锛屾垜鍋氫簡涓�浠跺鎴戞潵璇撮潪甯稿洶闅剧殑浜嬨�傗�濅絾濂圭殑Instagram璐﹀彿渚濈劧娲昏穬锛屾湁76.8涓囧悕绮変笣銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍚屾牱鍦帮紝SpaceX鍜岀壒鏂媺(Tesla)鐨勯甯墽琛屽畼鍩冮殕路椹柉鍏�(Elon Musk)鍒犻櫎浜嗚繖涓ゅ鍏徃鍦‵acebook涓婄殑涓婚〉锛屼絾涓ゅ鍏徃浠ュ強浠栬嚜宸卞湪Instagram涓婄殑璐︽埛渚濈劧寰堟椿璺冦�備粬鍦═witter涓婅锛屽彧瑕佽繖涓収鐗囧垎浜钩鍙扳�滀繚鎸佺浉褰撶殑鐙珛鎬р�濆氨濂姐��\r\n\r\n\r\n39宀佺殑鏂拏鑺疯�冨厠鏂�(Stephen Cox)鏄礇鏉夌煻鐨勪竴鍚嶆湪宸ャ�傚墠涓嶄箙锛屼粬鍦‵acebook涓婂彂甯栫О锛屼粬鍑嗗鍋滅敤鑷繁鐨勮处鎴凤紝杞�屼娇鐢↖nstagram銆傛湁浜鸿瘎璁鸿锛岃繖涓や釜缃戠珯褰掑悓涓�瀹跺叕鍙告墍鏈夛紝浠栧洖绛旇锛氣�滆繖鏄竴鎶婂弻鍒冨墤锛屼絾瀵规垜鏉ヨ锛屾湁涓�闈㈡瘮鍙︿竴闈㈡洿閽濅竴浜涖�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n浜嬪疄璇佹槑锛屽綋浜轰滑瀵笷acebook涓荤珯澶卞幓鍏磋叮鎴栦俊浠绘椂锛孖nstagram瀵瑰畠鏉ヨ鏄竴绉嶆湁鏁堢殑缂撳啿鎵嬫銆傛牴鎹毊灏ょ爺绌朵腑蹇�(Pew Research Center)1鏈堜唤瀵�2002鍚嶇編鍥芥垚骞翠汉杩涜鐨勮皟鏌ワ紝鑷�2016骞翠互鏉ワ紝浣跨敤Facebook鐨勭編鍥芥垚骞翠汉鐨勬瘮渚嬩竴鐩翠繚鎸佸湪68%锛岃�屽湪杩欐鏃堕棿閲岋紝Instagram鐨勪娇鐢ㄧ巼浠�28%涓婂崌鍒颁簡35%銆傝璋冩煡杩樺彂鐜帮紝Instagram鍦ㄥ勾杞讳汉涓瘮鍦ㄥ勾闀胯�呬腑鏇村彈娆㈣繋銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n26宀佺殑闆烽洴路甯冮瞾娉藉(Rayven Bruzzese)鏄垂鍩庣殑涓�鍚嶆墜璇鐢熴�傚ス璇达紝澶氬勾鏉ワ紝濂圭粡甯镐娇鐢‵acebook锛屼絾3鏈堜唤锛屽ス鍒犻櫎浜嗚嚜宸辩殑璐﹀彿锛屽洜涓哄ス瑙夊緱瀹冭鑷繁蹇冪儲鎰忎贡锛屾氮璐逛簡寰堝鏃堕棿銆傜幇鍦ㄥス鎶婃椂闂磋姳鍦ㄤ簡Instagram涓娿��\r\n\r\n\r\n铏界劧濂规壙璁わ紝鎹㈠埌鍙︿竴涓粛鐒跺綊Facebook鎵�鏈夌殑鏈嶅姟骞冲彴鏈夌偣璁藉埡锛屼絾濂硅濂圭殑閫夋嫨寰堟湁闄愩�傚ス鐨勬湅鍙嬩滑鍑犱箮閮戒笉鐢═witter锛屽緢澶氫汉涔熶笉鍐嶄娇鐢⊿napchat銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滄垜璇ュ幓鍝効鍛紵鈥濃�濆ス璇达紝鈥滄垜甯屾湜鏈夊埆鐨勫钩鍙般�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n娆㈣繋鍦═witter涓婂叧娉ㄦ湰鏂囦綔鑰� @jacknicas銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氶檲浜︿涵銆佺帇鐩稿疁"
