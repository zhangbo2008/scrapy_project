"By NICK WINGFIELD, PAUL MOZUR and MICHAEL CORKERY; APRIL 4, 2018\r\nSEATTLE 鈥� To see what it is like inside stores where sensors and artificial intelligence have replaced cashiers, shoppers have to trek to Amazon Go, the internet retailer鈥檚 experimental convenience shop in downtown Seattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon, though, more technology-driven businesses like Amazon Go may be coming to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA global race to automate stores is underway among several of the world鈥檚 top retailers and small tech startups, which are motivated to shave labor costs and minimize shoppers鈥� frustrations, like waiting for cashiers. They are also trying to prevent Amazon from dominating the physical retail world as it does online shopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompanies are testing robots that help keep shelves stocked, as well as apps that let shoppers ring up items with a smartphone. High-tech systems like the one used by Amazon Go completely automate the checkout process. China, which has its own ambitious e-commerce companies, is emerging as an especially fertile place for these retail experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf they succeed, these new technologies could add further uncertainty to the retail workforce, which is already in flux because of the growth of online shopping. An analysis last year by the World Economic Forum said 30-50 percent of the world鈥檚 retail jobs could be at risk once technologies like automated checkout were fully embraced.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the efforts have raised concerns among privacy researchers because of the mounds of data that retailers will be able to gather about shopper behavior as they digitize their locations. Inside Amazon Go, for instance, the cameras never lose sight of a customer once he or she enters the shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of Hema鈥檚 checkout kiosks, where shoppers can use facial recognition technology for payment.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetailers had adopted technologies in their stores long before Amazon Go arrived on the scene. Self-checkout kiosks have been common in supermarkets and other stores for years. Kroger, the grocery chain, uses sensors and predictive analytics tools to better anticipate when more cashiers will be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the opening of Amazon Go in January was alarming for many retailers, who saw a sudden willingness by Amazon to wield its technology power in new ways. Hundreds of cameras near the ceiling and sensors in the shelves help automatically tally the cookies, chips and soda that shoppers remove and put into their bags. Shoppers鈥� accounts are charged as they walk out the doors.\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere are retailers experimenting more avidly with automating store shopping than in China, a country obsessed by new tech fads.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne effort is a chain of more than 100 unmanned convenience shops from a startup called Bingo Box, one of which sits in a business park in Shanghai. Shoppers scan a code on their phones to enter and, once inside, scan the items they want to buy. The store unlocks the exit door after they have paid through their phones.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlibaba, one of China鈥檚 largest internet companies, has opened 35 of its Hema automated grocery stores, which blend online ordering with automated checkout. Customers scan their groceries at checkout kiosks, using facial recognition to pay electronically, while bags of groceries ordered by customers online float overhead on aerial conveyors, headed to a loading dock for delivery to shoppers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone, JD, another big internet retailer in China, said in December that it had teamed up with a developer to build hundreds of its own unmanned convenience shops. The businesses put readable chips on items to automate the checkout process.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt its huge campus south of Beijing, JD is testing a new store that relies on computer vision and sensors on the shelves to know when items have been taken. The system tracks shopping without tagging products with chips. Payment, which for now still happens at a kiosk, is done with facial recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\nJD and Alibaba both plan to sell their systems to other retailers and are working on additional checkout technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in the United States, Walmart, the world鈥檚 largest retailer, is testing the Bossa Nova robots in dozens of its locations to reduce some tedious tasks that can eat up a worker鈥檚 time. The robots, which look like giant wheeled luggage bags, roll up and down the aisles looking for shelves where cereal boxes are out of stock and items like toys are mislabeled. The machines then report back to workers, who restock the shelves and apply new labels.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 120 of Walmart鈥檚 4,700 U.S. stores, shoppers can also scan items, including fruits and vegetables, using the camera on their smartphones and pay for them using the devices. When customers walk out, an employee checks their receipts and does a 鈥渟pot check鈥� of the items they bought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hema attendant showing how a food code can be scanned with a smartphone.\r\n\r\n\r\nKroger, one of the country鈥檚 largest grocery chains, has also been testing a mobile scanning service in its supermarkets, recently announcing that it would expand it to 400 of its more 2,700 stores.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew startups are seeking to give retailers the technology to compete with Amazon鈥檚 system. One of them, AiFi, is working on cashierless checkout technology that it says will be flexible and affordable enough that mom-and-pop retailers and bigger outlets can use it. In the United States, venture capitalists put $100 million into retail automation startups in each of the past two years, up from about $64 million in 2015, according Pitchbook, a financial data firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淭here鈥檚 a gold rush feeling about this,鈥� said Alan O鈥橦erlihy, chief executive of Everseen, an Irish company working with retailers on automated checkout technology that uses artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile such technologies could improve the shopping experience, there may also be consequences that people find less desirable. Retailers like Amazon could compile reams of data about where customers spend time inside their doors, comparable to what internet companies already know about their online habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚t鈥檚 combined with everything else Amazon might know about you,鈥� said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties organization. 鈥淎mazon knows what I buy online, what I watch and now how I move around a space.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nIn China, there is less public concern about data privacy issues. Many Chinese citizens have become accustomed to high levels of surveillance, including widespread security cameras and government monitoring of online communications.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending on how heavily retailers automate in the years to come, job losses could be severe in a sector that has already experienced wave after wave of store closings by the likes of Macy鈥檚, Toys 鈥淩鈥� Us and Sears.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetailers are playing down the threat to jobs. Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, says that it does not anticipate automation will lead to job losses, but rather that the new technologies are meant to redirect employees to spend more time helping customers find what they need.\r\n\r\nNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, Paul Mozur from Shanghai, and Michael Corkery from New York.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�4鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圢ICK WINGFIELD, 瀛熷疂鍕�, MICHAEL CORKERY锛�\r\n瑗块泤鍥锯�斺�旀兂鐪嬬湅鐢ㄤ紶鎰熷櫒鍜屼汉宸ユ櫤鑳藉彇浠ｄ簡鏀堕摱鍛樼殑鍟嗗簵閲屾槸浠�涔堟牱鐨勶紝璐墿鑰呭繀椤诲墠寰�缃戠粶闆跺敭鍟嗕簹椹��(Amazon)鍦ㄨタ闆呭浘甯備腑蹇冨紑璁剧殑璇曢獙鎬ф棤浜轰究鍒╁晢搴椾簹椹�� Go銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n涓嶈繃锛屾洿澶氬儚杩欐牱鐢辩鎶�椹卞姩鐨勫晢搴楀緢蹇氨浼氭潵鍒拌喘鐗╄�呰韩杈广��\r\n\r\n\r\n涓�浜涗笘鐣屾渶椤剁骇鐨勯浂鍞晢鍜屽皬鍨嬬鎶�鍒濆垱鍏徃姝ｅ湪鍏ㄧ悆鑼冨洿鍐呰繘琛岃嚜鍔ㄥ寲鍟嗗簵鐨勭珵浜夛紝杩欎簺鍒濆垱鍏徃甯屾湜鍓婂噺鍔冲姩鎴愭湰锛屾妸璐墿鑰呯殑涓嶆弧鈥斺�斾緥濡傛帓闃熺粨璐︹�斺�旈檷鍒版渶浣庛�傚畠浠繕鍦ㄨ瘯鍥鹃樆姝簹椹�婂儚鎺у埗缃戠粶璐墿涓�鏍锋帉鎺у疄浣撻浂鍞競鍦恒��\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欎簺鍏徃姝ｅ湪娴嬭瘯濉厖璐ф灦鐨勬満鍣ㄤ汉锛屼互鍙婅璐墿鑰呴�氳繃鏅鸿兘鎵嬫満褰曞叆鍟嗗搧鐨勫簲鐢ㄣ�傚寘鎷簹椹�� Go杩欐牱鐨勯珮绉戞妧绯荤粺浼氭妸椤惧缁撹处鐨勮繃绋嬪畬鍏ㄨ嚜鍔ㄥ寲銆傛嫢鏈変紬澶氬織鍚戣繙澶х殑鐢靛晢鍏徃鐨勪腑鍥斤紝灏ゅ叾鎴愪簡杩涜杩欎簺闆跺敭瀹為獙鐨勬矁鍦熴��\r\n\r\n\r\n濡傛灉瀹冧滑鍙栧緱鎴愬姛锛岃繖浜涙柊鎶�鏈彲鑳戒細杩涗竴姝ュ鍔犻浂鍞笟鍔冲姩鍔涘競鍦虹殑涓嶇‘瀹氭�э紝杩欎釜甯傚満宸茬粡鍥犱负缃戠粶璐墿鐨勫闀垮彉寰椾笉绋冲畾銆備笘鐣岀粡娴庤鍧�(World Economic Forum)鍘诲勾鐨勪竴椤瑰垎鏋愭寚鍑猴紝涓�鏃﹀儚鑷姩缁撹处杩欐牱鐨勬妧鏈畬鍏ㄨ鎺ュ彈锛屽叏鐞�30锛�-50锛呯殑闆跺敭涓氬伐浣滃彲鑳介潰涓存秷澶辩殑椋庨櫓銆�\r\n\r\n姝ゅ锛岃繖浜涘姫鍔涘紩璧蜂簡闅愮鐮旂┒鑰呯殑鎷呭咖锛屽洜涓洪浂鍞晢鍦ㄦ暟瀛楀寲浠栦滑鐨勫簵閾烘椂鍙互閲囬泦澶ч噺鏈夊叧璐墿鑰呰涓虹殑鏁版嵁銆備緥濡傦紝鍦ㄤ簹椹�� Go鍐呴儴锛岃喘鐗╄�呬竴鏃﹁繘鍏ュ晢搴楋紝搴楀唴鎽勫儚澶翠細鏃犳椂鏃犲埢鐩戣浠栦滑銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n涓�鍚嶈喘鐗╄�呭湪闃块噷宸村反鏃椾笅鐨勪究鍒╁晢搴楃洅椹矞鐢熺敤鏅鸿兘鎵嬫満鎵弿鍟嗗搧銆傝繖瀹跺叕鍙告鍦ㄥ叾鍟嗗簵閲屽疄楠岃嚜鍔ㄥ寲璐墿鐨勬柟寮忋��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏃╁湪浜氶┈閫� Go鍑虹幇涔嬪墠灏卞凡缁忔湁闆跺敭鍟嗗湪搴楀唴浣跨敤鑷姩鍖栨妧鏈�傚骞存潵锛岃嚜鍔╃粨璐︽満鍦ㄨ秴甯傚拰鍏朵粬鍟嗗簵涓凡缁忓彉寰楀緢甯歌銆傛潅璐ц繛閿佸晢搴楀厠缃楁牸(Kroger)浣跨敤浜嗕紶鎰熷櫒鍜岄娴嬪垎鏋愬伐鍏锋潵鏇村ソ鍦伴娴嬩綍鏃堕渶瑕佹洿澶氭敹閾跺憳銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鐒惰�岋紝浜氶┈閫� Go鍦ㄤ竴鏈堝紑涓氫护寰堝闆跺敭鍟嗘劅鍒扮揣寮狅紝瀹冧滑鐪嬪埌浜氶┈閫婄獊鐒舵効鎰忎互鏂扮殑鏂瑰紡杩愮敤鍏舵妧鏈姏閲忋�傚ぉ鑺辨澘涓婄殑鏁扮櫨鎽勫儚澶村拰璐ф灦涓婄殑浼犳劅鍣ㄥ彲浠ヨ嚜鍔ㄨ褰曡喘鐗╄�呭彇鍑哄苟鏀惧叆浠栦滑鍖呬腑鐨勯ゼ骞层�佽柉鐗囧拰姹芥按銆傝喘鐗╄�呰蛋鍑哄晢搴楁椂锛屼粬浠殑甯愭埛浼氳嚜鍔ㄧ粨璐︺��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄧ棿杩蜂簬鏂扮鎶�鏃跺皻鐨勪腑鍥斤紝闆跺敭鍟嗘牸澶栫儹琛蜂簬杩涜鑷姩鍖栧晢搴楀疄楠屻��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍏朵腑涓�椤瑰姫鍔涙槸涓�瀹跺悕涓虹激鏋滅洅瀛愮殑鍒涗笟鍏徃锛屼粬浠紑浜嗕竴鐧惧瀹舵棤浜鸿繛閿佷究鍒╁簵锛屽叾涓竴瀹朵綅浜庝笂娴风殑涓�涓晢涓氬洯鍐呫�傝喘鐗╄�呭彲浠ョ敤鎵嬫満鎵弿浜岀淮鐮佽繘鍏ュ晢搴楋紝鐒跺悗鍦ㄥ簵鍐呮壂鎻忎粬浠兂瑕佽喘涔扮殑鐗╁搧銆傞�氳繃鎵嬫満浠樻鍚庯紝鍟嗗簵灏嗘墦寮�鍑哄彛銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n鍜岀數鍟嗗法澶翠含涓溿�佸垵鍒涘叕鍙哥激鏋滅洅瀛愪竴璧凤紝鐩掗┈椴滅敓杩庡悎浜嗘瘮缇庡浗璐墿鑰呮洿涔犳儻浜庨殣绉佷镜鐘殑涓浗娑堣垂鑰呫�� \r\n\r\n涓浗鏈�澶х殑浜掕仈缃戝叕鍙镐箣涓�闃块噷宸村反寮�璁句簡35瀹跺悕鍙洅椹矞鐢熺殑鑷姩鍖栭鏉傚簵锛屽皢鍦ㄧ嚎璁㈣喘鍜岃嚜鍔ㄧ粨璐﹁瀺涓轰竴浣撱�傞【瀹㈠埌缁撹处鏈烘壂鎻忓晢鍝侊紝浣跨敤闈㈤儴璇嗗埆杩涜鐢靛瓙浠樻锛屽湪浠栦滑鐨勫ご椤讹紝鐢遍【瀹㈢綉璐殑椋熸潅璐х墿姝ｉ�氳繃绌轰腑浼犻�佸甫閫佸線涓�涓璐х偣锛屽噯澶囬�掗�佺粰椤惧銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n涓浗鍙︿竴瀹跺ぇ鍨嬩簰鑱旂綉闆跺敭鍟嗕含涓滀篃涓嶇敇绀哄急锛屽畠鍦ㄥ幓骞�12鏈堣〃绀哄凡缁忎笌寮�鍙戝晢鍚堜綔寤洪�犱簡鏁扮櫨瀹舵棤浜轰究鍒╁晢搴椼�傝繖瀹朵紒涓氬湪鍟嗗搧涓婂畨瑁呬簡鍙鑺墖锛屼粠鑰屽疄鐜拌嚜鍔ㄥ寲缁撹处銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄥ叾浣嶄簬鍖椾含鍗楄竟鐨勪竴鏍嬪ぇ妤奸噷锛屼含涓滄鍦ㄦ祴璇曚竴绉嶆柊鍨嬪晢搴楋紝瀹冧緷闈犺揣鏋朵笂鐨勮绠楁満瑙嗗儚鍜屼紶鎰熷櫒鏉ュ緱鐭ュ晢鍝佷粈涔堟椂鍊欏凡琚拱璧般�傝绯荤粺鏃犻渶浣跨敤鑺墖鏍囪鍟嗗搧灏卞彲浠ヨ窡韪喘鐗╄繃绋嬨�傜粨璐︾洰鍓嶈繕闇�瑕佸湪鏀堕摱鏈猴紝鏄�氳繃闈㈤儴璇嗗埆瀹屾垚鐨勩��\r\n\r\n\r\n浜笢鍜岄樋閲屽反宸撮兘璁″垝灏嗚嚜宸辩殑绯荤粺鍗栫粰鍏朵粬闆跺敭鍟嗭紝骞朵笖閮藉湪鐮斿彂鍏朵粬缁撹处鎶�鏈��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄧ編鍥斤紝鍏ㄧ悆鏈�澶х殑闆跺敭鍟嗘矁灏旂帥(Walmart)姝ｅ湪鏁板崄涓湴鏂规祴璇旴ossa Nova鏈哄櫒浜猴紝浠ュ噺灏戜竴浜涘崟璋冧箯鍛炽�佽�楄垂宸ヤ汉鏃堕棿鐨勪换鍔°�傝繖浜涚湅浼煎法鍨嬭疆寮忚鏉庣鐨勬満鍣ㄤ汉鍦ㄨ繃閬撻噷鏉ユ潵鍥炲洖锛屽鎵鹃害鐗囪劚閿�鍜岀帺鍏风瓑鐗╁搧琚创閿欐爣绛剧殑璐ф灦銆傜劧鍚庤繖浜涙満鍣ㄥ悜宸ヤ汉鍙嶉锛屼粬浠細琛ヨ揣骞惰创涓婃柊鐨勬爣绛俱��\r\n\r\n鍦ㄧ編鍥�4700瀹舵矁灏旂帥闂ㄥ簵涓紝120瀹跺簵鐨勯【瀹㈠彲浠ョ敤鏅鸿兘鎵嬫満涓婄殑鎽勫儚澶存壂鎻忔按鏋滃拰钄彍绛夊晢鍝侊紝骞剁敤鏅鸿兘鎵嬫満浠樿处銆傞【瀹㈢寮�鏃讹紝浼氭湁涓�鍚嶅伐浣滀汉鍛樻鏌ヤ粬浠殑灏忕エ锛屽苟瀵逛粬浠喘涔扮殑鍟嗗搧杩涜鈥滄娊鏌モ�濄��\r\n\r\n\r\n浣滀负缇庡浗鏈�澶х殑椋熷搧鏉傝揣杩為攣涔嬩竴锛屽厠缃楁牸涓�鐩村湪鑷繁鐨勮秴甯傞噷娴嬭瘯涓�椤圭Щ鍔ㄦ壂鎻忔湇鍔★紝骞跺湪鏈�杩戝甯冨皢鎶婂畠鎵╁ぇ鍒板叾2700瀹堕棬搴椾腑鐨�400瀹躲��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏂扮殑鍒濆垱鍏徃姝ｅ湪浜夊彇缁欓浂鍞晢鎻愪緵涓庝簹椹�婄殑绯荤粺绔炰簤鐨勬妧鏈�傚叾涓紝AiFi姝ｅ湪鐮旂┒鏃犳敹閾跺憳缁撹处鎶�鏈�傝鍏徃绉拌繖绉嶆妧鏈伒娲汇�佺粡娴庯紝澶搴楀拰杈冨ぇ鐨勯浂鍞簵閮借兘浣跨敤銆傛嵁閲戣瀺鏁版嵁鍏徃Pitchbook绉帮紝鍦ㄧ編鍥斤紝椋庨櫓鎶曡祫浜鸿繃鍘讳袱骞存瘡骞村悜闆跺敭鑷姩鍖栧垵鍒涘叕鍙告姇璧�1浜跨編鍏冿紝鑰�2015骞磋繖涓暟瀛楃害涓�6400涓囩編鍏冦��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滆繖鏈変竴绉嶆窐閲戠儹鐨勬劅瑙夛紝鈥濈埍灏斿叞鍏徃Everseen鐨勯甯墽琛屽畼鑹句鸡路娆ц但鍒╁笇(Alan O 'Herlihy)璇淬�傝鍏徃姝ｅ湪涓庨浂鍞晢鍚堜綔寮�鍙戜娇鐢ㄤ汉宸ユ櫤鑳界殑鑷姩缁撹处鎶�鏈��\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欑被鎶�鏈櫧鐒跺彲鑳戒細鏀瑰杽璐墿浣撻獙锛屼絾涔熷彲鑳戒骇鐢熶汉浠笉閭ｄ箞鍠滄鐨勫悗鏋溿�傚儚浜氶┈閫婅繖鏍风殑闆跺敭鍟嗗彲浠ユ敹闆嗗ぇ閲忔湁鍏抽【瀹㈠埌搴楀悗鎶婃椂闂磋姳鍦ㄤ簡鍝噷鐨勬暟鎹紝绫讳技浜庣綉缁滃叕鍙稿浜轰滑涓婄綉涔犳儻鐨勪簡瑙ｃ��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n鍖呮嫭娌冨皵鐜涘拰鍏嬬綏鏍煎湪鍐呯殑缇庡浗闆跺敭鍟嗘鍦ㄦ祴璇曞儚鐩掗┈椴滅敓鐨勭粨璐﹁繖鏍风殑鍏堣繘鑷姩鍖栨妧鏈�� \r\n\r\n鈥滃畠鍚屼簹椹�婂彲鑳戒簡瑙ｅ埌鐨勪綘鐨勫叾浠栨墍鏈変俊鎭粨鍚堣捣鏉ワ紝鈥濆湪绾垮叕姘戣嚜鐢辩粍缁囩數瀛愬墠娌垮熀閲戜細(Electronic Frontier Foundation)鐨勭爺绌跺憳鍩哄Ξ路鏍煎竷鍝堢壒(Gennie Gebhart)璇淬�傗�滀簹椹�婄煡閬撴垜鍦ㄧ綉涓婁拱浠�涔堬紝鐪嬩粈涔堬紝鐜板湪鍙堢煡閬撲簡鎴戝湪涓�涓湴鏂圭殑绉诲姩杞ㄨ抗銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄤ腑鍥斤紝鍏紬瀵规暟鎹殣绉侀棶棰樹笉閭ｄ箞鍏虫敞銆傚緢澶氫腑鍥藉叕姘戜範鎯簡楂樺害鐨勭洃瑙嗭紝鍖呮嫭骞挎硾瀛樺湪鐨勭洃鎺ф憚鍍忓ご鍜屾斂搴滃缃戜笂浜ゆ祦鐨勭洃瑙嗐��\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欎釜琛屼笟宸茬粡缁忓巻浜嗘瑗跨櫨璐�(Macy's)銆佺帺鍏峰弽鏂楀煄(Toys 鈥淩鈥� Us)鍜岃タ灏旀柉(Sears)涔嬬被涓�娉㈠張涓�娉㈠叧搴楁疆锛屼粖鍚庡け涓氱幇璞″彲鑳戒細寰堜弗閲嶏紝杩欏叿浣撳彇鍐充簬闆跺敭鍟嗗湪鎺ヤ笅鏉ュ嚑骞撮噷鐨勮嚜鍔ㄥ寲绋嬪害浼氭湁澶氶珮銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n闆跺敭鍟嗘鍦ㄦ贰鍖栬嚜鍔ㄥ寲瀵瑰氨涓氱殑濞佽儊銆備綔涓虹編鍥芥渶澶х殑绉佷汉闆囦富锛屾矁灏旂帥绉帮紝瀹冮璁¤嚜鍔ㄥ寲涓嶄細瀵艰嚧瑁佸憳锛屽苟琛ㄧず鏂版妧鏈殑鏈剰鏄噸鏂拌鍛樺伐鎶婃洿澶氭椂闂寸敤鍦ㄥ府鍔╅【瀹㈡壘鍒颁粬浠渶瑕佺殑涓滆タ涓娿��\r\n\r\n\r\n瀛熷疂鍕�(Paul Mozur)鏄�婄航绾︽椂鎶ャ�嬮┗涓婃捣璁拌�呫��\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Wingfield鑷タ闆呭浘銆佸瓱瀹濆嫆鑷笂娴枫�丮ichael Corkery鑷航绾︽姤閬撱��\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氱航绾︽椂鎶ヤ腑鏂囩綉"
