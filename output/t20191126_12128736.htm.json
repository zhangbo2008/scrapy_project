"¡¡¡¡Culture is the soul of a nation. The power of culture is deeply embedded in the vitality, creativity, and cohesion of a nation. The resilience of Chinese culture is forged with blood, fire and pain; its spirit is dyed red with the blood of countless martyrs. Today Chinese culture is becoming increasingly influential, and the world is seeing a real, multi-dimensional and comprehensive image of China."
