"\r\n三架波音737 Max 8喷气式飞机停在上海的一个机场。在埃塞俄比亚航空坠机事故发生后，中国是首批停飞该机型的国家之一。\nBEIJING — Once known for its deadly skies, China doubled down on aviation safety as it grew in wealth and power.\r\n\n北京——随着财富与权力的增长，曾经空难频频的中国也在加强航空安全。\r\n\nThis week, as it took the lead among world governments in grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8, China showed its willingness to assert itself in airline safety.\r\n\n本周，中国先于世界各国政府禁飞波音737 Max 8客机，表明了在航空安全领域坚持自己主张的意愿。\r\n\nChinese regulators acted swiftly on Monday, grounding 96 of the 737 Max 8 jetliners operated by Chinese carriers less than 20 hours after one operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed on Sunday. It was less than five months after a similar deadly accident involving that model.\r\n\n中国的监管机构周一迅速采取行动，下令中国运营商停飞其所运营的96架波音737 Max 8喷气式客机，距离周日埃塞俄比亚航空飞机失事尚不足20小时。此次空难距该型号客机上一次类似的死亡事故不到五个月。\r\n\nAlthough dozens of other governments, from Indonesia to France, also banned the flights after China’s decision, it was not until Wednesday that the United States said it would also do so.\r\n\n尽管从印度尼西亚到法国的其他几十个国家政府继中国之后也做出了禁飞决定，但美国直到周三才表示它也将采取同样做法。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nThat is a big shift from a generation ago, when Chinese regulators largely followed the Federal Aviation Administration’s lead. Today, Chinese airlines are among the safest in the world, according to industry statistics.\r\n\n这和十年前相比是个很大的转变，那时中国的监管机构基本上是跟在联邦航空管理局（Federal Aviation Administration，简称FAA）后面亦步亦趋。如今，航空数据表明，中国的航空公司属世界上最安全之列。\r\n\n“In the past, we mainly acted according to F.A.A.’s decision,” said Lin Zhijie, an aviation consultant in the southeastern city of Xiamen. “If F.A.A. said ‘ground,’ we’d ground, and vice versa.”\r\n\n“过去我们主要根据FAA的决定行事，”东南城市厦门的航空顾问林志杰（音）说。“如果FAA说‘禁飞’，我们就禁飞，反之亦然。”\r\n\nBeijing regulators’ willingness to act on their own now, Mr. Lin said, “is a landmark event, and worth watching.”\r\n\n如今北京监管机构有了自主行事的意愿，这在林看来是“里程碑式的事件，值得关注”。\r\n\nInvestigators are beginning to explore what caused the Ethiopian Airlines crash, which killed 157 people. It is not clear whether the Max 8 has a fatal safety flaw. But the Chinese airline industry said the precautionary move was a sign of its commitment to safety.\r\n\n调查人员正在开始探究致使157人遇难的埃航事故的原因。尚不明确Max 8是否具有致命的安全缺陷。但中国航空工业表示，采取预防行动是其安全承诺的标志。\r\n\n“China Eastern Airlines has 14 Max 8 planes, and we have already suspended all of them,” Liu Shaoyong, the airline’s president, said this week as governments and other carriers were still deciding how to react.\r\n\n“中国东方航空有14架Max 8飞机，我们已经将其全部暂停运营，”东航董事长刘绍勇本周在政府及其他运营商仍在决定如何应对时即称。\r\n\n“Our primary concern is for the safety of lives and to maintain a strong sense of responsibility,” he said.\r\n\n“我们首先关心的是生命安全和保持强烈的责任感，”他说。\r\n\nThe challenge for China will be whether it can sustain its improved safety record as its airline sector continues to grow. In its annual market forecast, Boeing predicted that China would make up nearly one-fifth of global air traffic by 2037, compared with about 14 percent now — an expansion that will require purchasing thousands of planes and training legions of new pilots.\r\n\n中国的挑战在于能否在航空部门持续增长的同时保持其安全记录的改进。在年度市场预测中，波音预测2037年中国将占全球空中交通的近五分之一，而当前仅占14%——这一扩张将需要采购数千架飞机，培训大批新飞行员。\r\n\nConcerns over training linger. This week, Li Jian, the deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, cited uncertainties over whether pilots could fly planes manually if they were to encounter problems with automated systems.\r\n\n培训方面仍存在担忧。本周，中国民用航空局副局长李建提到对于如遇自动系统故障，飞行员是否能手动飞行的不确定性。\r\n\r\n\nThe cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash is not yet clear. But the groundings were driven in part by regulators’ concerns about similarities to a deadly accident in October, when a Max 8 flown by Lion Air crashed off the coast of Indonesia, killing 189 people. Preliminary inquiries into that crash suggested that a combination of poorly maintained flight instruments and a balky automated flight system might have played a role.\r\n\n埃航失事的原因尚不清楚。但禁飞令部分是由于监管机构担心其与10月份一起致命事故的相似之处，当时印尼狮子航空(Lion Air)一架Max 8班机在印尼海岸坠毁，导致189人遇难。对这起空难的初步调查显示，飞行仪器维护不佳以及固执己见的自动飞行系统这两方面合在一起，可能导致了空难的发生。\r\n\nChinese airlines have done extra training with the automated flight control system since the Lion Air crash.\r\n\n自狮航空难之后，中国的航空公司已就该自动飞行控制系统进行了额外培训。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\n“Our pilots have the ability to deal with it — we could simply shut down the computer intervention,” said Noa Sun, a pilot in China of Boeing 737s, although he has not yet flown the Max 8 version of the plane. He also cautioned that, if there was a problem, no pilot would have much time to react.\r\n\n“我们飞行员有能力应对它——我们可以直接关闭计算机干预，”中国的飞行员诺阿·孙(Noa Sun)说，他是波音737飞行员，尽管还没有驾驶过Max 8版本。但他也提醒说，如果发生问题，飞行员可能没有多少时间做出反应。\r\n\nChina has broad ambitions to compete with the United States and Europe in the business of flying airliners. The country is building its own jets, with long-term ambitions to compete with Boeing and with Airbus, the European aerospace giant. China makes airliner electronics equipment and is developing its own jet engines. And its executives now play major roles in international air transport organizations.\r\n\n中国怀着同美国和欧洲在客机飞行业务上展开竞争的远大抱负。中国正在建造自己的喷气机，并有着与波音和欧洲航空巨头空客(Airbus)进行竞争的长期目标。中国已在制造客机电子设备，并正在研发属于自己的喷气机引擎。其业界高管如今也在国际航空运输组织中发挥主要作用。\r\n\nThat increased global participation includes airline safety. The International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations specialized agency that coordinates global aviation regulations, chose a Chinese regulator as its secretary general for the first time in 2015. The regulator, Fang Liu, an aviation law expert who long worked for China’s main flight regulatory agency, was reappointed last year to a second three-year term.\r\n\n这种全球参与的加强也包括航空安全。联合国专门协调全球民航法规的机构国际民用航空组织(International Civil Aviation Organization)2015年首次选择了一位中国监管者担任秘书长。这位名叫柳芳的监管官员曾作为航空法律专家长期效力于中国主要的飞行监管机构，去年她被再次得到任命，进入第二个三年任期。\r\n\nSome of these ambitions have raised concerns within the Trump administration because the line between civil and military technology can blur quickly in the aviation business.\r\n\n其中一些抱负引发了特朗普政府内部的担忧，因为民用和军事技术之间的界线在航空行业中可以很快变得模糊。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nFor example, the China Aviation Industry Corporation, a state-owned enterprise better known as AVIC, has become a big producer of commercial aircraft components for Boeing. It also makes some of the world’s most advanced stealth fighter jets for the Chinese Air Force. The Trump administration put some kinds of aircraft equipment, like jet engines, in the initial 25 percent tariffs that it imposed last summer on $50 billion a year of goods imported from China.\r\n\n例如，国有企业中国航空工业集团公司(AVIC)已成为波音商用飞机零部件的大型生产商。它还为中国空军制造了一些世界上最先进的隐形战斗机。去年夏天，特朗普政府对每年从中国进口的500亿美元商品征收25%的关税，包括喷气机引擎在内的某些飞机设备也被加入关税名单之中。\r\n\nChina has not always been so self-confident in international aviation. A spate of deadly crashes in the 1990s, including seven from 1992 to 1994 that killed a total of 492 people, prompted China to turn to the F.A.A. for help. The F.A.A. sent advisers and provided voluminous information on how it regulated practically every detail of aircraft operations in the United States.\r\n\n中国在国际航空领域并不总是那么自信。1990年代，中国发生了一系列致命坠机事故，1992年至1994年发生的七起事故共造成492人死亡，这促使中国向美国联邦航空管理局寻求帮助。联邦航空管理局派出顾问，提供了大量信息，说明它是如何监管美国飞机行动的几乎所有细节。\r\n\nChinese regulators successfully adopted the same procedures. While other fast-growing economies in middle-income countries have had periodic crashes, China has not had a major crash since 2010. That was when an Embraer ERJ-190LR, imported from Brazil and operated by Henan Airlines, crashed and burned while trying to land on a foggy runway in northeastern China. The crash killed 44 of the 96 people aboard.\r\n\n中国监管机构成功地采用了同样的程序。尽管中等收入国家其他快速增长的经济体会不时发生坠机事故，但自2010年以来，中国就没有发生过严重的坠机事故。当时，河南航空一架从巴西进口的巴西航空工业公司(Embraer)ERJ-190LR飞机在试图在大雾天气下，在中国东北一条跑道上降落时失事并起火。机上96人，44人遇难。\r\n\nSome of the ways China keeps its skies safe are familiar — sometimes, annoyingly so — to frequent fliers. Even in good weather, Chinese airports do not let planes take off or land as quickly in succession as many airports in the West. When thunderstorms threaten, they space out the takeoffs and landings even more. Sometimes air traffic controllers tell pilots to land somewhere else. Long delays lead to frequent stories in the Chinese media of frustrated passengers who start fights or open an emergency door for fresh air. But the measures help keep fliers safe.\r\n\n经常乘坐飞机的人已经熟悉了中国保障飞行安全的一些方法，有时它们令人恼火。即使天气好，中国的机场也不像西方许多机场那样让飞机连续起飞，或者降落得和西方机场一样快。当雷暴来袭时，中国会让起降间隔更大。有时空中交通管制员会告诉飞行员在其他地方降落。长时间的延误导致中国媒体频繁报道沮丧的乘客打架，或是打开紧急舱门呼吸新鲜空气。但这些措施有助于保障乘客的安全。\r\n\nChina passed the United States in 2005 as the world’s biggest market for the delivery of new commercial jets and has never looked back. But while China initially imported almost everything for its commercial aviation sector, it is working hard to learn how to make planes and equipment itself.\r\n\n2005年，中国超过美国，成为全球最大的新型商用飞机交付市场，并且一直保持首位。不过，尽管最初中国几乎所有民用航空产品都是进口的，但它正在努力学习如何自己制造飞机和设备。\r\n\nAirbus now assembles dozens of A320 jets, a competitor to the Boeing 737 although not the most advanced version, at an assembly plant in the Chinese port city of Tianjin. AVIC entered a joint venture with General Electric eight years ago to manufacture some of the world’s most sophisticated aircraft electronics.\r\n\n空中客车目前在中国港口城市天津的一家装配厂组装了数十架A320客机。A320是波音737的竞争对手，尽管并不是最先进的机型。中航工业8年前与通用电气(General Electric)成立了一家合资企业，生产世界上一些最尖端的飞机电子产品。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\n\nA lavishly financed state-owned enterprise, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac, has developed a single-aisle passenger jet, the C919. Near Shanghai’s main international airport, Comac has a sprawling, brand-new campus of more than 110 buildings, some of which are designed for the simultaneous assembly of numerous aircraft.\r\n\n中国商用飞机有限责任公司是一家资金充裕的国有企业，开发了一款单通道客机C919。在上海主要国际机场附近，中国商飞拥有一个有110多座建筑的全新大型园区，其中一些建筑是为同时组装多架飞机而设计的。\r\n\nThe C919 had its first test flight two years ago. Comac had more than 500 orders for the plane before that flight even took off, although almost all of them were from Chinese state-controlled airlines. Comac is scheduled to start delivering the aircraft to the state-controlled carrier China Eastern, its first customer, in 2021.\r\n\nC919在两年前进行了首次试飞。在它起飞之前，中国商飞就接到了500多份订单，尽管几乎全都来自中国国有航空公司。中国商飞计划于2021年开始向其首个客户——国有航空公司中国东方航空交付这款飞机。\r\n\nThe 158-seat aircraft is designed to compete with Airbus’s A320neo and with Boeing’s 737 Max series.\r\n\n这款158座的飞机旨在与空客的A320neo和波音的737 Max系列展开竞争。\r\n\nChinese officials say their cooperation with airline regulators elsewhere shows their willingness to be part of the international aviation community.
