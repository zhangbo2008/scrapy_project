I was so nervous when I saw him there. I don't even know how I coped.'\n　　回忆起相恋的过程，席尔瓦说道：“我告诉过他许多次不要向我求婚，因为我的答案肯定是拒绝。当他向我求婚时我真是紧张极了，都不知道是怎么答应他的。”\n　　Construction worker Francinaldo added: 'I have always wanted to go out with a tall girl and she came and fitted into that perfectly.'\n　　弗兰奇纳尔多是一名建筑工人，他补充说：“我一直想和高个子女孩约会，她恰巧适时地出现了，正符合我心目中的理想女孩形象。”\n　　The couple are planning on a long engagement despite Elisany already having a dress for the big day. The newly engaged couple have not always seen eye to eye and Francinaldo had to work hard to get the ring on Elisany's finger.\n　　虽然席尔瓦已经备好了新婚礼服，但二人计划履行一个漫长的婚约。这对刚刚订婚的恋人并不总是看法完全一致，弗兰奇纳尔多必须努力奋斗，才有能力把戒指戴在席尔瓦的手指上。\n　　'When we met I had already turned 16,' she said. 'I was still a bit childish and so I was just playing around with him for a while and I got so annoyed with him - as if he was a rival that I hated. I just didn't like him and wanted to hit him every time we met.'\n　　“我们相遇时我16岁，” 席尔瓦说，“当时我还有些孩子气，在他身边玩耍时、感觉他很讨厌，就好像他是我憎恶的敌人一样。当时我就是不喜欢他，每次遇见他都想要揍他一顿。”\n　　But little Francinaldo has a big heart and remembers their meeting a little differently. He said: 'The first time I saw her I went to get some bread and I noticed her from a distance. I checked her out and she also checked me out straight away. Then I just thought, \"I need to be with that girl\". I always found her beautiful.'\n　　然而“小男友”弗兰奇纳尔多却胸怀宽广，在他的记忆中二人的相遇有一点特别。他说，“我第一次看见她的时候，当时我正要去取点面包，然后就注意到了远处的她。我盯着她看，她也盯着我看。那时候我就想我要和她在一起，我一直觉得她很漂亮。”"
