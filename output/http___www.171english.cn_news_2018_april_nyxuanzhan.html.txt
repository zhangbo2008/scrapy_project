Many of them spend more than a year in the program, and they are not allowed to teach until their English instructors say they are ready.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a complaint familiar to millions of alumni of research universities: the master鈥檚 or doctoral candidate from overseas, employed as a teaching assistant, whose accent is too thick for undergraduate students to penetrate. And it is an issue that many universities are addressing more seriously, using a better set of tools, than in years past.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淭hese are often students whose reading and writing in English is excellent, but whom Americans have a very hard time comprehending, and it calls for a lot of work,鈥� said Dawn Bikowski, the director of the English Language Improvement Program here.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt American universities, one in every six graduate students hails from another country 鈥� about 300,000 of them, almost half from China and India, according to the Institute of International Education. In science and technology fields, foreigners make up nearly half of the graduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose from China and other East Asian countries are often like Xingbo Liu, a graduate student in nutrition here, who said she had taken English classes nearly all her life. 鈥淏ut we only learn how to write and read,鈥� she said, 鈥渉ow to choose the right answer on a written test.鈥� Many Indian or African students have done most of their formal education in English and are comfortable speaking it, but with accents that challenge American ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淭his is something that nationwide, people are paying a lot more attention to,鈥� said James Tierney, the director of the English Language Program at Yale University. Universities worry not only about the foreigners鈥� ability to function as students and teachers, but also about 鈥渃ompeting on an equal footing in the job market when they graduate.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduate students require particular attention because their exposure to American education and culture can be much narrower, said Julia Moore, the director of the English Language Program at Northwestern University, with 鈥渇riends, colleagues, roommates and even faculty mentors who speak their languages.鈥� In addition to requiring language instruction for many graduate students, Northwestern enrolls them in a monthlong summer immersion program in American language and culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some cases, university action has been prodded by politicians. Louisiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington have laws requiring that instructors be intelligible, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and similar bills have been introduced in many other states in the last decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign applicants to American universities must submit scores on standardized tests of their English skills. In the not-too-distant past, that almost always meant a written exam. But university officials say that the growth of tests that include oral components has given them a much better idea of applicants鈥� speaking skills.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe test most commonly used by American institutions, the Test of English as a Foreign Language, or Toefl, added a spoken portion in 2005 when it was first administered online. The company that produces the exam, ETS, says that 98 percent of people who take it now take the Internet version, which includes listening and speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another step forward, professors say, increasingly sophisticated software programs analyze and critique speech. One program, NativeAccent, which became available three years ago, has been adopted by more than 100 universities.\r\n\r\n\r\nBriju Thankachan, an Indian graduate student here in instructional technology, has spent hundreds of hours using NativeAccent. The software can isolate hundreds of pronunciation issues and even show animations of how to position parts of the mouth for each sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淓very morning I would hear him repeating things over and over into the computer, and you could hear him getting better,鈥� said Mr. Thankachan鈥檚 wife, Betsy J. Briju, a visiting assistant professor in plant biology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comprehension problem is far from solved. Even at an institution like Ohio University, with an unusually robust remedial program, undergraduate students say they have run into hard-to-understand teaching assistants.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淵ou get better at understanding after a while, and they鈥檙e willing to talk it over again, but it can be hard,鈥� said Karen Martinez, a sophomore from Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe university鈥檚 efforts to address the accent problem date to the 1980s. Every foreign student鈥檚 command of spoken English is assessed on arrival, and each year about 300 go through the improvement program, part of the linguistics department.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn classes, the students learn to break language into individual sounds, forcing them to be aware of how each part of the mouth is positioned to make a particular bit, while instructors contort their faces and touch their tongues to drive home the point. Students take sentences apart to learn rhythm, emphasis, pauses and rising and falling pitch 鈥� elements that can convey as much information as words 鈥� and reinforce them with stair-hops and other physical exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淢any people come here without having learned intonation at all,鈥� said Lara Wallace, a lecturer in linguistics. 鈥淓verything comes out in a flat monotone, which makes an accent even harder to understand.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents are assigned to practice in computer labs, using the speech analysis software, and 鈥� possibly the most unpopular exercise 鈥� recording audio or video of themselves speaking. They have to transcribe those recordings verbatim, with every pause, false start, repetition or 鈥渦m鈥� noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚 like it and I hate it,鈥� said Xuan He, a 24-year-old sociology student. 鈥淓very time, I feel like I sound very stupid. But it is useful.鈥�"
