But finding gold in a patient's stomach was something unbelievable.\"\n　　“这是我第一次从病人胃里取出金子，”外科医生CS Ramachandran对BBC说，“我曾经从一个病人身体里取出1公斤重的膀胱结石，但是在胃里发现金子还真是不可思议。”\n　　According to SBS, the businessman had swallowed the bars in Singapore and then traveled to India on March 28.\n　　据澳大利亚SBS广播台报道，该商人是在新加坡的时候吞下的金条(为了混过安检走私入境)，然后在3月28日飞回了印度。\n　　When he arrived home, he faced a quandary. How to get the gold out? He reportedly started \"drinking lots of water and taking laxatives.\" It did no good, and the gold lodged in his small intestine.\n　　到家后他陷入窘境，该如何取出这些金子呢?报道说他开始“大量喝水并服用泻药”。但是都没有用，金子依然卡在小肠里。\n　　India, the world's largest consumer of gold, has seen a rise in gold smuggling since the government imposed a 10 per cent duty on gold bullion imports in April, up from eight per cent.\n　　印度是全世界的黄金消费国，自4月印度政府将黄金进口税从原先的8%提高到10%后，走私案件数量就显著增多。"
