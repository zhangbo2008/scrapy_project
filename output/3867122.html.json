Rich in polyphenols, research suggests that a blueberry-rich diet not only improves your motor skills, but also can help fight diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\n尽管果实小，蓝莓却有强大的抗衰老功能。研究表明，蓝莓富含多酚，食用蓝莓不仅能发展运动技能，还有助于对抗癌症、心脏病和糖尿病。\nIndeed one recent study published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association showed that women who ate the most blueberries -- as well as their superfood cousin, strawberries -- enjoyed a 32 percent lower heart attack risk than women who only ate these berries once a month (or not at all).\n近日发表在美国心脏学会期刊《循环》（Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association）上的一项研究指出，大量食用蓝莓和草莓的女性，比每月只吃一次或不吃的女性，患心脏病的几率要少32%。\n2. Oatmeal\n2.燕麦片\nFor years, research has shown a strong correlation between oatmeal and cholesterol reduction. Oatmeal is rich in soluble fiber that gets rid of \"bad\" cholesterol. Oats also are packed with the antioxidants that do battle against cell damage. And that can help plump skin and reduce wrinkles.\n多年来，研究表明燕麦片与降低胆固醇密切相关。燕麦片富含可溶性纤维，有助于降低胆固醇。燕麦含抗氧化剂，能对抗细胞损伤，令肌肤丰盈，减少皱纹。\n3. Eggs\n3.鸡蛋\nEggs usually come under fire because of their high cholesterol content. But studies show that healthy men and women who consume an egg a day actually do not experience negative health repercussions. In addition, eggs contain all the essential B vitamins: B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, choline, biotin, and folic acid. Choline has been shown to protect your memory, while two proteins in eggs -- lutein and zeaxanthin -- protect against vision loss.\n鸡蛋通常因高胆固醇含量而遭受批评。但研究表明，身体状况良好的男女每天吃一个鸡蛋，实际上不会对健康产生消极影响。另外，鸡蛋含所有人类需要的维生素B： B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12，胆碱，生物素，叶酸。胆碱已被证实能提高记忆力，而鸡蛋里的两种蛋白质――叶黄素和玉米黄质，有助于保护视力。4. Tea\n4.茶\nMany teas are high in anti-aging antioxidants. But green tea is rich in an antioxidant known as EGCG, which helps fight wrinkles and rejuvenate skin cells. Green tea also may protect against cancer, control blood sugar levels, and help reduce inflammation associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n许多茶类含有抗衰老的抗氧化剂。绿茶富含一种EGCG抗氧化剂，有助于对抗皱纹和激活皮肤细胞。同时，绿茶能预防癌症，控制血糖，减少与节段性肠炎和溃疡性结肠炎相关的炎症。If tea's not your thing, try pomegranate juice instead. Studies show that a glass of pomegranate juice a day could help keep wrinkles at bay. Not only has pomegranate been shown to slow down the natural oxidation (\"wear and tear\") of DNA, it also has been linked to the prevention of heart disease and stress relief.\n如果你不喜欢茶叶，那么试试石榴汁吧！研究表明，每天一杯石榴汁能助你对抗皱纹。石榴不仅延缓DNA的自然氧化（消耗），还能预防心脏病和缓解压力。6. Grapefruit\n6.葡萄柚\nIn addition to helping you feel full, which in turn may assist with weight loss, grapefruit also can help lower \"bad\" cholesterol and triglyceride levels while also boosting “good” HDL cholesterol. Deep red varieties are best as studies show they can also help keep heart disease at bay.\n葡萄柚能让你产生饱胀感，因此也有助于减轻体重。葡萄柚能减少体内不利于健康的胆固醇和甘油三酯，同时增加有利于健康的HDL胆固醇。研究表明，深红的葡萄柚预防心脏病的效果。\nOne caveat: Grapefruit can prove hazardous when combined with certain prescription medicines.\n小贴士：葡萄柚不能与一些处方药一起食用。"
