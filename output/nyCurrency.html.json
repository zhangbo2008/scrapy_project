Or you can cut the price — say, from $1 to 85.7 cents — and still make your original 6 renminbi in sales. Your American competitor, who has to buy and sell in dollars, has to grudgingly cut prices to compete.\r\n\n但当人民币汇率跌至兑美元为7的时候，一美元的火烈鸟在销售额上就等于7元人民币。或者你也可以降价——比如从一美元降到85.7美分——销售额就仍然是原本的6元人民币。但你那些必须以美元交易的美国竞争对手为了能与之竞争，就得不情愿地降价。\r\n\n(It’s a lot more complicated in the real world. The plastic and metal for the plastic flamingo may have been imported to China and are priced in dollars.

Right now, the United States imposes tariffs of about 10 percent on a wide variety of Chinese goods that arrive at an American port.

But in this case, many of the forces weakening the currency are beyond Beijing’s immediate control.\r\n\n长期以来，一些美国及其他地方的政治人士一直在说中国操纵汇率，尽管华盛顿官员——包括特朗普政府内的官员——并没有做出正式的指责。但具体在这里，许多导致人民币疲软的因素都不在北京直接可控的范围内。\r\n\nChina’s financial system is firmly controlled by the government, giving the country’s leaders a great degree of control over how much the renminbi is worth. Officials set a daily benchmark rate for the renminbi and allow its value to move a smidgen above or below that level in currency markets. Chinese officials say each day’s trading activity helps determine the value they set for the renminbi the next day, but they disclose few details about how that works.\r\n\n中国金融体系由政府牢牢把控，这让该国领导人就人民币价值几何拥有大量控制权。官员们每日为人民币设下基准汇率，并且允许其价值在货币市场中在该水平上小幅上下波动。中国官员表示，每天的交易活动能有助于为第二天人民币汇率定价，但他们很少披露运作过程的细节。\r\n\nOn Tuesday, Beijing set that guidepost at 6.9574, just a hair’s breadth stronger than 7. In the world of foreign exchange, a higher number means a weaker currency.\r\n\n周二，北京将基准设为6.9574，仅比7强一点。在外汇市场上，数字越大，货币就越走弱。\r\n\nRight now, traders are sending Beijing a single message: The renminbi should be worth less. The people and companies that hold the currency have become increasingly nervous about China’s slowing economic growth, slumping stock market, fragile real estate market and seemingly intractable trade war with the United States. Inflation has begun to tick upward, and rising prices tend to make holding the relevant currency less attractive.\r\n\n目前，交易员们正在给北京发出一条信息：人民币不应再贬值了。面对中国放缓的经济、暴跌的股市、脆弱的房地产市场及与美国似乎很棘手的贸易战，持有人民币的个人和公司愈发感到紧张不安。通货膨胀开始上升，上涨的物价也将让持有相关货币变得不那么具有吸引力。\r\n\nThere are other reasons. Since late July, Beijing has tried to prop up the economy by having the state-controlled banking sector increase lending, making money more available. That means even more renminbi sloshing around, weakening the currency’s value.\r\n\n还有其他原因。自7月底以来，北京一直在试图通过让国家控制的银行业增加借贷、让人们能借到钱，来提振经济。这意味着市场上将流通更多人民币，会进一步削弱人民币币值。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nWhile China hasn’t raised interest rates, the Federal Reserve in Washington has. That makes it attractive for many people to sell their renminbi and buy dollars. Would you rather have a one-year renminbi certificate of deposit that pays 1.5 percent interest now, or a one-year dollar C.D. that pays out 2.6 percent or more?\r\n\n尽管中国还没有加息，华盛顿的美联储已经这么做了。这会引得更多人卖掉手中的人民币，买入美元。你会更愿意有一张利率为1.5%的人民币一年存单，还是利率为2.6%甚至更高的美元一年存单？\r\n\nIs the drop deliberate on Beijing’s part?\r\n\n人民币贬值是北京蓄意为之的吗？\r\n\nNot quite. If anything, Beijing is trying to keep the renminbi from falling too fast.\r\n\n不见得。真要说有什么举措的话，北京反倒在试图阻止人民币贬值太快。\r\n\nChina has a number of ways to bolster the currency’s value. One option is to follow the Fed’s example and raise interest rates. That would give Chinese families and companies more incentive to keep their money in China. But that would raise the cost of borrowing in China, just as the economy is slowing.\r\n\n要想抬高币值，中国有各种手段。一个选择就是按照美联储的做法，提高利率。这将让中国的家庭与公司有更多将资金留在中国的动力。但这个做法会提高在中国借贷的成本，尤其是在经济放缓的时候。\r\n\nBeijing could buy up its own currency instead. Like anything else, the renminbi’s value rises when it is scarcer.\r\n\n北京可以通过购买提升人民币币值。就像其他东西一样，当变得更稀有的时候，人民币币值会升高。\r\n\nThanks to the way it has managed its currency over the years, China has amassed the world’s largest foreign exchange reserves — a $3 trillion stash of money it keeps in dollars, euros, pounds, yen and other currencies. It has begun to tap that stash. When China’s central bank released its monthly balance sheet a week ago, it showed a drop of almost $20 billion in foreign currency just during September.\r\n\n多亏了中国多年来管理货币的方式，中国已经积聚起了世界上最大的外汇储备——价值3万亿美元的资金，分别为美元、欧元、英镑、日元及其他货币。中国已经开始动用这笔资金。当中国央行上周公布其月份资产负债表时，表上显示出9月期间，外汇储备下降约200亿美元。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\n“Selling almost $20 billion in a month won’t break the bank,” said Brad W. Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “But it does indicate the direction of current market pressure.”\r\n\n“在一个月里卖出近200亿美元不会耗尽储备，”纽约的美国外交关系委员会(Council on Foreign Relations)经济学家布拉德·W·塞策(Brad W. Setser)表示。“但它确实表明了目前市场压力的方向。”\r\n\nWhat are the broader risks?\r\n\n更广泛的层面有什么风险？\r\n\nThree years ago, as its economy slowed, China devalued the renminbi in part to give its factories a helping hand. The financial world was shocked. Markets plunged.\r\n\n3年前，随着经济放缓，中国让人民币贬值，部分是为了帮中国工厂一把。当时金融世界受到震动，股市暴跌。\r\n\nAs Chinese officials hurried to explain themselves, people and companies began shifting their money — money that China’s economy needed — outside the country. A year later, China had spent more than $500 billion from its reserves in an effort to shore up the renminbi. It later tightened controls on the financial system to shut off many ways people used to get money out of the country.\r\n\n就在中国官员匆忙为自己的行为作出解释的时候，个人和公司开始将自己的资金转出国外，而这些资金正是中国经济所需要的。一年后，为了支撑人民币，中国已经将外汇储备花掉了超过5000亿美元。中国后来收紧了对金融体系的控制，关掉了许多人们曾经用来将资金转出国外的渠道。\r\n\nShould the trade war intensify, China may look to make more aggressive moves with its currency. But as history shows, there can be a price to pay.\r\n\n如果贸易战恶化，中国可能会在货币方面考虑更加激进的措施。但历史表明，这么做是有代价的。\r\n\nKeith Bradsher是《纽约时报》上海分社社长，欢迎在Twitter上关注他 @KeithBradsher。\r\n\n\r\n翻译：纽约时报中文网\r\n"
