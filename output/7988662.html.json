"f the shoe fits,but you don’t buy it, you could soon be tarred with the same brush as shoplifters by shoe store owners.\n　　如果鞋子合脚，你却不买，鞋店老板可能把你当作冒充顾客进店行窃的扒手对待――这种事情在不久以后可能成为现实。\n　　Worried retailers are increasingly frustrated by people they dub “fit-lifters” who use stores to find the best-fitting shoes before buying them online at a lower price.\n　　现在有一些人把商店当做试鞋间、选好款式后上网以更便宜的价格购买。忧心忡忡的零售商们对这种事情感到越来越头疼。他们称这种人为“试穿贼”(fit-lifter)。\n　　Bricks-and-mortar shops have higher salary and rental costs than internet rivals and store owners say some online buyers are freeriding on their resources. “You’ve come in and stolen that service basically,” said Richard Napier of Idaho Mountain Trading, an outdoor sports store in Idaho Falls, who calls fit-lifting unethical.\n　　与电商相比，实体商店的人员和租金成本更高。实体店的老板们称，一些网购顾客正在白蹭他们的资源。爱达荷瀑布市(Idaho Falls)一家户外运动品商店――爱达荷登山用品商店(Idaho Mountain Trading)的理查德?内皮尔(Richard Napier)称，在实体店试穿、然后在网上购买的行为是不道德的。他说：“你来店里、然后偷走了那项服务，基本就是这么回事。\n　　“It’s not that the salesperson didn’t have somebody else to serve who would have bought something. So not only have you stolen the wages. I have a loss of revenue that he would have collected from another customer.”\n　　“销售人员并不是没有别的顾客要招呼――那些真正想买点东西的顾客。因此，你偷走的不仅是商店支付给销售人员的工资，还有本来可能从其他顾客那里获得的销售收入。”\n　　It is common for online shoppers to research products in stores in other retail sectors such as bookselling C a practice named “showrooming” C and smartphones make it possible to buy online even while still in a store. But the trend is particularly contentious in footwear because staff spend so much time fetching boxes and advising customers on comfort.\n　　在图书等其他零售领域，网购者在商店里“研究产品”是很常见的行为。这种行为被称为“参观陈列室”，并且只要有智能手机，“参观者”在实体店里面的时候就可以在线购买某样产品。但这种趋势在鞋类零售业中引起了特别大的争议，因为鞋类商店的员工花了那么多时间为顾客取鞋，提供有关鞋子舒适度的建议。\n　　Tensions have been heightened by the price advantage that ecommerce gains from the fact that many online shoppers do not have to pay state and local sales tax,"
