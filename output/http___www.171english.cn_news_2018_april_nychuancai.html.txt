You either get out immediately, vanquished and penitent, or something inside you changes. Inside your stomach and inside your brain, the surge of dopamine alters the neurochemistry, requiring the addict to seek to match that first, miraculous high. My initiation occurred in 1997 at Wu Liang Ye, one of Manhattan鈥檚 first Sichuan restaurants, which, the manager told me, was opened by the People鈥檚 Republic of China to promote awareness of the variety and complexity of Chinese cuisine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis act of culinary propaganda was enormously successful 鈥� Sichuan restaurants soon began appearing all over New York. I later followed the Sichuan trail to restaurants in Sunset Park, Bensonhurst and the subterranean food courts in Flushing, which require a Chinese-speaking guide to navigate properly. It was a pastime, I told myself, all in good fun. Then I read about the San Gabriel Valley, east of Los Angeles, which has the most-concentrated Chinese community in the U.S. and a staggering array of Sichuan restaurants. The most prominent of these 鈥� the Sichuan king of San Gabriel 鈥� is Chung King. The next time I was in L.A., I drove straight to San Gabriel Boulevard. That鈥檚 when I lost control. I don鈥檛 know if Chung King is the best Sichuan restaurant in America, but I can attest that it induces delirium.\r\n\r\n\r\nA clarification: Sichuan food should not be confused with what most Americans understand to be Chinese food. It is distinguished by spicy, oil-based sauces that are flavored by salt, garlic, ginger, pickled chilies, doubanjiang 鈥� a spicy paste made from broad beans 鈥� and, most crucially, Sichuan peppercorns, which burst like Bang Snaps on your tongue and give the food its trademark flavor: ma la (鈥渘umbing spicy鈥�). When your mouth is coated with ma la, water tastes like flat ginger ale. One Sichuan devotee I know describes the ma la sensation as a 鈥渢onguegasm.鈥� The pulse increases and the pupils dilate, often accompanied by a postnasal drip. The brain floats in a euphoric ether.\r\n\r\n\r\nSichuan menus tend to list approximately 800 dishes, and at many lesser restaurants each comes drowned in a numbing, spicy oil. But Sichuan cuisine has, in fact, 22 other flavors besides ma la. This I learned from Fuchsia Dunlop鈥檚 definitive Sichuan cookbook, 鈥淟and of Plenty,鈥� in which she describes each of these flavors, including 鈥渞ed-oil flavor,鈥� 鈥渇ragrant wine flavor鈥� and, my favorite, 鈥渟trange-flavor,鈥� which combines ma la with han (salty), tian (sweet), suan (sour), xian (fresh-savory) and xiang (fragrant) notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my return to Chung King this summer, I determined to try as many of the 23 flavors as possible. I began with Chung King-flavored noodles; these were numbing and spicy, to be certain, but also had a note of 鈥渟corched-chili flavor,鈥� which is derived from mixing fried, dried chili with soy sauce, Sichuan pepper, vinegar, garlic and sugar. A dry, cumin-dusted lamb rubbed with large chunks of garlic and chili peppers delivered the dense 鈥渟moked flavor.鈥� Spicy eggplant, a Sichuan staple, tasted as if it had been fermented in vinegar, a blending of the 鈥渉omestyle鈥� and 鈥渇ish-fragrant鈥� flavors. Most magnificent, however, were the boiled fish slices, garnished with fresh cilantro, in a bowl of hot sauce, in which could be perceived not just the Sichuan peppercorn but also star anise 鈥� a trademark of the elite 鈥渇ive-spice flavor.鈥� The fried chicken with garlic and crunchy red chili peppers might have been imbued with the sublime 鈥渟trange-flavor,鈥� but by that point my mouth was numb.\r\n\r\n\r\nI always make a point of ordering some dish unsettling to the Western sensibility in the assumption that it must be authentic and therefore marvelous. At Chung King, the best way to do this is to walk to the back of the restaurant, where there stands a kind of deli counter arrayed with a number of cold dishes that the restaurant does not include on the English menu. I pointed at a platter that seemed to contain thin slabs of red marble. I was told that these were sliced pig ears. They were salty and greasy (鈥淪ichuan pepper flavor,鈥� from raw Sichuan pepper mashed with green scallions, salt and sesame oil). I ate them all."
