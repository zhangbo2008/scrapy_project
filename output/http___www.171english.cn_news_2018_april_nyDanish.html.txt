That tradition has been spurred on by other Danish firsts. It was the first country in the world to legalize printed pornography, in 1967; in 1969 it lifted censorship of all movies for adults. It was also the first to legalize same-sex civil unions, in 1989. (Same-sex marriage was sanctioned there in 2012.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hooper visited Copenhagen for the first time last year, he 鈥渃ompletely fell in love鈥� with it, he said. In the film he wanted to pay homage to the city and the blue-gray paintings of the 19th century artist Vilhelm Hammershoi, whose works Mr. Ebershoff called 鈥渕asterpieces of subdued longing.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nTightknit Denmark 鈥� current population: 5.6 million 鈥� has been defined for more than a century by a sense of social tolerance.

The first color live action film made in Denmark, 鈥淜ispus,鈥� from 1956, features a lovably eccentric fashion designer, Mr. Marcel. 鈥淨uite clearly, this character is marked as a gay man in the film, and it鈥檚 not something that鈥檚 made fun of,鈥� Mr. Tybjerg said. Other daring movies include 鈥淰enom鈥� (1966, also known as 鈥淕ift鈥�), about a hedonistic young man who films his sexual dalliances and watches hard-core pornography 鈥� though the explicit footage was then censored with big white crosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom left, Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne in 鈥淭he Danish Girl.鈥�\r\n\r\nThe end of film censorship in 1969 led to a flurry of movies with both explicit and nuanced themes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was the 1970 counterculture 鈥淐oncerning Lone,鈥� about a teenage girl who travels to Copenhagen鈥檚 hippie area, later has exuberant topless sex, gets pregnant and seeks an illegal abortion. In 1978, 鈥淵ou Are Not Alone鈥� was the first Danish movie to show two boys in love. Joyfully honest, it includes scenes of teenage boys kissing and also caressing naked in the shower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReleased in 1987, 鈥淔orever Friends鈥� took a thoughtful approach to its story of a doe-eyed new guy in school becoming friends with a clique leader who is gay.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet amid this candor lies an entrenched Scandinavian concept, the law of Jante, satirically coined by the Danish author Aksel Sandemose in the 1930s, about being reservedly modest and not trumpeting individual success.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚 was brought up in a country that was very open, especially when it comes to sexuality, growing up as a young woman being able to talk to your parents about this from a young age,鈥� said Ms. Vikander, a Swede whose father, a psychiatrist, has worked with transgender patients. 鈥淛ante will always be a part of me, in the sense that I was also brought up with people holding back just a tiny bit, at home.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some way Lili, too, doesn鈥檛 want to stand out, Mr. Hooper said. 鈥淓ddie and I had conversations with trans people about 鈥榩assing鈥� or blending in,鈥� he said. 鈥淟ili was really quite a conventional woman, and wanted to find a man and become pregnant one day.鈥� (Though details are vague about the scope of Elbe鈥檚 multiple surgeries, she died in 1931 after complications stemming from what may have been the attempted transplant of a uterus.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMs. Vikander said she also became enamored of the naturalistic Dogme 95 film movement introduced in 1995 by the directors Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg. Both Ms. Vikander and Mr. Hooper cited Mr. Vinterberg鈥檚 raw 1998 Dogme film, 鈥淭he Celebration,鈥� about family sexual abuse, as one of their favorite Danish movies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Dogme, progressive Danish films have included 鈥淪hake It All About鈥� (2001), which revolves around a man who proposes to his boyfriend, then also falls in love with a woman; the coming-of-age lesbian tale 鈥淭riple Threat鈥� (2006); and 鈥淟adyboy鈥� (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year, Denmark became the first European country to allow a legal change of gender without requiring a medical diagnosis.
