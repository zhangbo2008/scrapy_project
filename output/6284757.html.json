Merit certificates she received from school are displayed on the wall. Yan Lingling, Xi's mother, said she is proud of her daughter.\n她跟母亲一起住在一个没有浴室的房间里，每月房租费330元。她家墙上挂着她从学校获得的奖状。她的母亲严玲玲谈到自己为女儿感到骄傲。\nAccording to the family planning policy, couples in which both the husband and wife have rural residential permits can have another child if their first is a daughter. Yan said she isn't planning on adding to the family because she wants to give her daughter the best she has.\n根据计划生育政策，一对拥有农村户口的夫妇如果第一胎是个女孩的可以多生育一个孩子。严母说自己不打算在多生育个孩子，因为她想把自己的留给女儿。\n\"My husband is away most of the time, working in construction sites and making no more than 30,000 yuan ($4,840) a year. I work as an hourly worker sometimes. The rent of our apartment is expensive. One more child means one more burden,\" Yan said. \n“我的丈夫大部分时间都不在家，他在建筑工地工作，每年的收入有3万元左右，而我有时候做点零时工。公寓的房租太贵了，多一个孩子意味着更多的负担。”她这样说到。\n\"My husband's parents, who live in the village, have been pressuring us to have a son to pass on his family name. But my daughter is also our blood.\"\n“我丈夫的父母住在乡下，他们也催促我们赶紧要个儿子传宗接代，但是女儿也一样是我们的骨血。”\nSpeaking about how she plans to achieve her dream of becoming a teacher, Xi said: \"I will not give up on my dream easily, though I know it may be difficult. When something becomes difficult, it only makes me want to try harder.\"\n当谈及她如何实现自己成为教师的计划时，小席说：“我不会轻易放弃自己的梦想的，尽管我知道要实现目标很困难。当事情变的困难，那只会让我更想努力试试。”"
