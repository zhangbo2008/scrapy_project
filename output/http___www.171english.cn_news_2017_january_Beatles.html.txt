He was 86.\r\nThe Jacaranda Club in Liverpool, which Williams once owned, announced his death on social media Friday.\r\nWilliams worked with the band from 1960 to 1961, allowing them to play at the Jacaranda, while also booking gigs for them in Britain and elsewhere.\r\nHe drove the band in his van to Hamburg, Germany, where the Beatles' popularity began to take off.\r\nShortly after Williams and the band parted ways, Brian Epstein became the band's manager and the rest is legendary music history.\r\nWilliams told The Liverpool Echo in 2010, \"I've always been proud of The Beatles and proud and happy to have been just a small cog in the wheel of the most famous group in the world.\" \r\nWilliams wrote a memoir entitled \"The Man Who Gave The Beatles Away.\""
