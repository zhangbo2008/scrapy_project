I can’t really exaggerate. Nobody will believe us.”\r\n\n“很难去宣传一部我自己都没信心的电影，”他在2011年的一次采访中说。 “我不太会说假话。 我不会夸大其词。没人会信的。”\r\n\nSo the studio founder, Run Run Shaw, invited him to contribute his ideas on scripts, and he soon became a producer. Mr. Chow longed for more freedom over his work, and in 1970 he left to co-found his own studio, Golden Harvest.\r\n\n于是公司创始人邵逸夫请他为电影剧本出谋划策，他很快成为制片人。邹文怀渴望有更多的工作自由，在1970年离开邵氏与人合办了自己的电影公司嘉禾。\r\n\n\r\n李小龙在1971年的电影《唐山大兄》中。 \n\r\nGolden Harvest’s initial films did poorly against Shaw Brothers, which dominated the local market. But Mr. Chow then outbid his former employer to sign Bruce Lee, a young actor and martial arts expert who had appeared in the sidekick role of Kato on the American television series “The Green Hornet.”\r\n\n嘉禾早期出品的影片很难与当时统领本港市场的邵氏抗衡。但邹文怀随后以高于前东家的出价签下了李小龙，这名年轻的演员和武术家在美国电视连续剧《青蜂侠》(The Green Hornet)中扮演过配角加藤。\r\n\nMr. Chow had seen Mr. Lee break boards in displays of powerful kicks and punches on Hong Kong television, and learned that Shaw Brothers had been unable to sign him to a film contract.\r\n\n邹文怀在香港电视节目中见过李小龙展现有力的拳脚，击碎木板，他还得知邵氏公司没能跟李小龙签电影合约。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nGolden Harvest offered him $15,000 for two films, along with a share of the profits and greater say in the production. Mr. Lee agreed, and Mr. Chow quickly flew his new actor to Thailand, where, in rough rural conditions, he filmed “The Big Boss” in 1971.\r\n\n嘉禾提出以15000美元与他签下两部电影合约，并许以一定的利润分成和对影片更大的决定权。李小龙答应了，邹文怀很快让他的新演员飞到泰国，1971年在条件艰苦的泰国乡野，他拍摄了《唐山大兄》。\r\n\nMr. Lee’s intense aura and florid fight scenes helped the film become the most successful one shown in Hong Kong to that point, breaking the box-office total set by “The Sound of Music.” That success was followed by hits including “Fist of Fury” and “The Way of the Dragon.”\r\n\n李小龙强烈的个人魅力和华丽的打斗场面使该片成为当时香港最成功的公映影片，打破了此前由《音乐之声》(The Sound of Music)保持的票房纪录。此后的《精武门》和《猛龙过江》接二连三获得成功。\r\n\n“In our early action films, we used actors who knew little about fighting,” Mr. Chow told The New York Times in 1973. “We had to use various camera tricks. But the audience can tell the difference. It knows a real fighter when it sees one. That’s why Bruce Lee has been such a hit.”\r\n\n“我们早期的动作片，用的都是不怎么会打的演员，”邹文怀1973年接受《纽约时报》采访时说，“我们只好在摄影上用各种花招，但观众还是看得出来。他们一看就知道这个人真的会打，所以李小龙会那样卖座。”\r\n\nAfter Mr. Lee’s death in 1973, Jackie Chan became a breakout star for Golden Harvest. He first imitated Mr. Lee, then modified his style to develop a more irreverent, comedic style of kung fu film.\r\n\n李小龙1973年去世后，成龙成为嘉禾公司的新星。他起初模仿李小龙，后来改成一种更随性、更搞笑的功夫片风格。\r\n\n\r\n李小龙（右）和邹文怀（中）在《龙争虎斗》拍摄现场 \n\r\nMr. Chao also discovered Angela Mao, who is called the first female kung fu star, and produced her first major film, “Hapkido,” or “Lady Kung Fu,” in 1972.\r\n\n邹文怀还发现了号称香港首位功夫女星的茅瑛，并在1972年出品了她的第一部电影《合气道》。\r\n\n“I have to thank God and Raymond Chow,” she told The Times in 2016.\r\n\n“我要感谢上帝和邹文怀。”2016年她对时报说。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nMr. Chow pursued films in Hollywood in the 1980s, and Golden Harvest produced several American box-office hits, including “The Cannonball Run,” with an ensemble cast that included Burt Reynolds. Mr. Chow found small roles for Mr. Chan and the Hong Kong comedian Michael Hui in the movie, hoping to develop the market for Chinese actors in the United States.\r\n\n1980年代邹文怀到好莱坞投拍电影，嘉禾出品了多部卖座的美国片，包括云集了伯特·雷诺兹(Burt Reynolds)等明星阵容的《炮弹飞车》(The Cannonball Run)。邹文怀在片中为成龙和香港喜剧演员许冠文安排了小角色，希望为中国演员开辟美国市场。\r\n\nWhile his works were often critically panned, Mr. Chow had an eye for box-office success. In the 1990s, Golden Harvest produced the “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” series, based on earlier comic books and cartoons. The first film took in more than $200 million.\r\n\n尽管他的这些影片常常获得劣评，邹文怀瞄准的是票房成功。1990年代，嘉禾出品了根据早期漫画书和卡通片改编的系列电影《忍者龟》(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)。第一部影片票房超过2亿美元。\r\n\nMr. Chow was born in Hong Kong on Oct. 8, 1927. He attended St. John’s University in Shanghai before returning to Hong Kong in 1949, when Mao Zedong and the Communist Party took over China. He worked as a journalist for outlets including The Hong Kong Standard and Voice of America.\r\n\n邹文怀1927年10月8日生于香港，他在上海就读圣约翰大学，1949年毛泽东和共产党取得政权后，他回到香港。他曾在英文《虎报》及美国之音等新闻媒体担任记者。\r\n\nThe names of his survivors were not immediately available.\r\n\n他在世亲人的名字尚未可知。\r\n\nHis production company had a long run of success, but it stumbled after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, just as mainland China’s film industry began to grow. He sold his stake in the company in 2007 to the mainland businessman Wu Kebo, who merged it with his own entertainment group to create Orange Sky Golden Harvest Entertainment.\r\n\n他的电影公司获得了多年成功，但在1997年亚洲金融危机后一蹶不振，那也正是中国内地电影业开始发展之时。2007年他把自己持有的公司股份卖给内地商人伍克波，后者将其与自己的娱乐集团合并，成立了橙天嘉禾娱乐。\r\n\nIn a 2013 interview with The South China Morning Post, Mr. Chow described a liberated, collaborative style as the underpinning of his work.\r\n\n在2013年《南华早报》的一次采访中，邹文怀形容自己的事业基调是一种自由、协作的风格。\r\n\n“My philosophy is to entertain people, to make people happy,” he said. “Filmmaking also suits my way of thinking: I love freedom, and don’t like being placed under restrictions.”\r\n\n“我的哲学就是娱人，使他人快乐，”他说。“做电影也适合我的思考方式：我喜欢自由，不喜欢受限制。”\r\n\n王霜舟(Austin Ramzy)是《纽约时报》记者。\r\n\r\n\n翻译：Hongyu Li\r\n"
