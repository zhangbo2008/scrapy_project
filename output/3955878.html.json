I remember at 15 talking to my aunt on the 15th anniversary of her 21st birthday about the stigma of aging. Later that evening, I asked my grandfather about the hula girl tattoo on his arm.\n　　成长需要时间。我仍然记得15岁时，在阿姨21岁生日派对上讨论变老的可怕。那天晚上，我还问爷爷他手臂上纹着的跳草裙舞女孩是谁。\n　　“That’s your grandma,” he proudly answered before stretching out the skin on his forearm and quipping, “and this is what she used to look like.”\n　　“那是你奶奶。”他骄傲地答道，然后伸出小臂俏皮地说，“这是她年轻时的模样。”\n　　Don’t struggle through another year―shake off those birthday blues with these useful questions to unlock your mind.\n　　不要勉强应付着长一岁――反思下面这些生活问题，抛开生日忧郁，点亮自我心灵吧。\n　　1. Where was I this time last year?\n　　去年此时我是什么阶段?\n　　Forecasting is both the most and least important part of planning. To get an accurate picture of where you are, you need to check where you were last year at the same time. Are you still on the right path? If not, what threw you off course, and what can you do to get back up and moving in the right direction?\n　　预测是计划中最重要的部分，但也最容易被忽略。若想明确判断自己处于怎样的阶段，就得回顾去年此时的状态。现在你还在正确的道路上吗?若不是，那么是什么让你偏离了方向?你又该怎么做才能回归到正确方向上呢?\n　　2. Am I who I want to be?\n　　我是自己期望的样子吗?\n　　When you were six years old, you had dreams of who you wanted to be. Are you that person? You may not be in the exact career, but are you the type of person you wished for? The happiest people live to please their inner child―that person you used to be before everyone taught you about “real” life.\n　　当你才6岁的时候，就梦想过自己成为怎样的人。现在你成为那样的人了吗?或许不尽其然，但你是否就是自己期望的类型呢?最快乐的人懂得取悦自己内心的“小孩”――那是你未曾经历现实生活之前的纯真自我。\n　　3. Have I lost/gained weight since last year?\n　　跟去年相比，我变瘦还是变胖了?\n　　What does your body look like compared to last year? If you wanted to lose or gain weight, did you? Did you bulk up like you wanted, or are you the same or worse? There’s no better time than now to strengthen your resolve to get into shape.\n　　跟去年相比，你现在的身材如何?如果你曾打算减肥或增胖，那么现在做到了吗?你有没有如愿长胖，或者没啥两样，甚至更瘦了?趁着现在的大好时机，赶紧下定决心塑造身形吧。\n　　4. Did I accomplish my goals for this year?\n　　我实现今年的目标了吗?\n　　It’s not just for the new year; everyone makes goals and resolutions throughout the year. Did you accomplish your goals for last year? What did you wish for when you blew out your candle? What did you do to make it happen?\n　　不仅在新年，每个人一年到头都会下定决心制定计划。你有没有实现去年的目标?吹灭生日蜡烛的那一刻，你许过怎样的愿望?为了实现愿望，你又做过什么呢?\n　　5. Why do I have to age?\n　　为什么我只能长大变老?\n　　Much like pooping, everyone ages. I have no more of an answer than anyone else. Just enjoy the life you have and try to find your smile. It’s the only way to truly live.\n　　跟排便一样，谁都会变老。我也想不出高人一等的答案。所以，尽管享受当下生活，努力保持微笑吧。这也是真实生活的方式了。"
