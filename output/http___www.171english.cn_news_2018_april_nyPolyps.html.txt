"A Short History of Presidential Health\r\nFrom brushing off gunshot wounds to working through paralysis, presidents, and those seeking the office, have been no strangers to challenging ailments. Here are a few of history鈥檚 most prominent examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revelation that Mrs. Clinton had pneumonia instantly drew comparisons to William Henry Harrison, the ninth president, whose tenure was the shortest in the country鈥檚 history. Harrison died from pneumonia, according to his doctor, in 1841, a month after delivering a two-hour inaugural address on a blustery day.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing underdressed in bad weather was blamed for causing an illness that quickly spiraled out of control. Doctors treated him with opium and other medications that proved to be useless.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorians continue to debate the true cause of Harrison鈥檚 death, and some scholars have wondered whether his history of dyspepsia, rather than pneumonia, was really to blame. According to one theory, the White House鈥檚 lack of a proper sewage system may have contaminated its water supply with pathogens that poisoned the president.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton鈥檚 campaign said that she had wanted to push through her pneumonia after it was diagnosed last Friday. For Douglas Brinkley, a Rice University historian, the urge to put politics before health echoed Theodore Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1912, Roosevelt, a former president, was running again with the Progressive 鈥淏ull Moose鈥� Party when he was shot in the chest before he was to deliver a speech in Milwaukee. The manuscript of the speech, which was in his coat pocket, cushioned the blow and saved his life. Gritting through the pain, he delivered a shortened version of the speech anyway, declaring, 鈥淚t takes more than that to kill a bull moose.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淗e thought if he went to a hospital and seemed infirm, it would lower his chances of winning,鈥� Mr. Brinkley said of Roosevelt, who ultimately lost the election.\r\n\r\n\r\n Woodrow Wilson\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Woodrow Wilson had a debilitating stroke in 1919, leaving him incapacitated and raising questions about who was really running the executive branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nScholars such as Edwin A. Weinstein, a neuropsychiatrist, spent years studying Wilson鈥檚 old correspondence to determine that he had experienced smaller strokes dating back to 1898, which might have foreshadowed his health problems later in life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransparency was particularly problematic at the time, as Wilson鈥檚 wife, Edith, and his doctor allegedly orchestrated a cover-up to prevent the public from learning about his deteriorating condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth was always something of a concern for Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was partly paralyzed and was vigilant about keeping his wheelchair hidden from the public. But it was when he sought his fourth term as president in 1944 that his opponents seized on his diminished strength and failing faculties in hopes of finally defeating him.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments in Roosevelt鈥檚 presidential library show how the 鈥渨hispering campaign鈥� of his rival Thomas E. Dewey tried to paint Roosevelt as a 鈥渢ired old man,鈥� and how Roosevelt campaigned more aggressively to demonstrate that he still had vigor. Privately, Roosevelt鈥檚 doctors had warned that he had high blood pressure and was at a high risk of heart failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 1945, Roosevelt collapsed and died from a cerebral hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn F. Kennedy\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy declared himself the 鈥渉ealthiest candidate for president in the country.鈥� But despite his youthful good looks, Kennedy was battling a variety of ailments, including Addison鈥檚 disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the adrenal glands.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite efforts by his family to hide the disorder, which can be life-threatening, pathologists who conducted his autopsy revealed in 1992 that Kennedy, who was assassinated at the age of 46, had been taking hormone replacement supplements to control the rare condition. Some suggested that he might have lost the 1960 election to Richard M. Nixon if the extent of his health problems had been known.\r\n\r\n\r\nA more extensive batch of medical records made public in 2002 showed that Kennedy also lived in considerable discomfort, taking painkillers, anti-anxiety agents, stimulants and sleeping pills. He was also hospitalized for back and intestinal problems and had osteoporosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nRonald Reagan\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oldest president ever to take office, Ronald Reagan endured an assassination attempt and the removal of cancerous polyps from his colon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome historians have blamed the colon surgery, in 1985, for poor decisions Reagan made related to the Iran-contra scandal while he was recuperating. Reagan transferred power briefly to Vice President George Bush, but rushed back to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淩eagan made a serious mistake in taking back his powers and duties,鈥� said Robert Gilbert, an emeritus professor of political science at Northeastern University and an expert on illness in the White House.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Gilbert, Reagan鈥檚 aides prevented people from seeing him because he was unwell, and he made decisions while hospitalized that he later did not remember.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�3鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圓LAN RAPPEPORT锛�\r\n浠庡鏋激杞绘弿娣″啓鍒版嫋鐫�鐦棯鐨勮韩浣撳伐浣滐紝缇庡浗鐨勬�荤粺鍜屾�荤粺鍊欓�変汉瀵规寫鎴樼柧鐥呭苟涓嶉檶鐢熴�備互涓嬫槸鍙蹭笂鏈�鏈夊悕鐨勪竴浜涗緥瀛愩��\r\n\r\n\r\n濞佸粔路浜ㄥ埄路鍝堥噷妫�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍏嬫灄椤胯鐖嗗嚭鎮ｆ湁鑲虹値鍚庯紝绔嬪嵆鏈変汉灏嗗叾鍜岀涔濅换鎬荤粺濞佸粔路浜ㄥ埄路鍝堥噷妫�(William Henry Harrison)杩涜姣旇緝銆傚搱閲屾．鏄編鍥藉巻鍙蹭笂鍦ㄤ换鏃堕棿鏈�鐭殑鎬荤粺銆傚搱閲屾．鐨勫尰鐢熺О浠栨浜庤偤鐐庯紝褰撴椂鏄�1841骞淬�傚湪鍘讳笘鐨勪竴涓湀鍓嶏紝浠栧湪涓�涓ぇ椋庡ぉ鍙戣〃浜嗛暱杈句袱涓皬鏃剁殑灏辫亴婕旇銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄦ伓鍔ｇ殑澶╂皵涓嬭。鐫�鍗曡杽琚寚鏄搱閲屾．鎮ｇ梾鐨勫師鍥犮�傚緢蹇紝鍝堥噷妫殑鐥呮儏澶辨帶銆傚尰鐢熷湪娌荤枟杩囩▼涓娇鐢ㄤ簡楦︾墖鍜屽叾浠栬嵂鐗╋紝浣嗕簨瀹炶瘉鏄庯紝杩欎簺閮芥病鐢ㄣ��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍘嗗彶瀛﹀浠嶅湪璁ㄨ鍝堥噷妫殑鐪熸姝诲洜锛屼竴浜涘鑰呮��鐤戯紝鐪熸瑕佹�殑鏄惁鏄粬鐨勬秷鍖栦笉鑹梾鍙诧紝鑰屼笉鏄偤鐐庛�傛湁涓�绉嶇悊璁烘槸锛屽ぇ姒傚洜涓虹櫧瀹病鏈夊畬鍠勭殑涓嬫按閬撶郴缁燂紝鍥犺�屼緵姘翠腑鍚湁鐥呭師浣擄紝鍝堥噷妫洜姝ゆ劅鏌撱��\r\n\r\n瑗垮ゥ澶毬风綏鏂\r\n\r\n\r\n鍏嬫灄椤跨殑绔為�夊洟闃熺О锛屼笂鍛ㄤ簲纭瘖涓鸿偤鐐庡悗锛屽厠鏋楅】鏈兂鎾戣繃鍘汇�傚湪鑾辨柉澶у(Rice University)鍘嗗彶瀛﹀閬撴牸鎷夋柉路甯冩灄鍏嬪埄(Douglas Brinkley)鐪嬫潵锛屾兂鎶婃斂娌荤殑閲嶈鎬ф斁鍦ㄥ仴搴峰墠闈紝杩欎竴鐐逛笌瑗垮ゥ澶毬风綏鏂(Theodore Roosevelt)棰囦负鐩镐技銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n1912骞达紝韬负鍓嶆�荤粺鐨勭綏鏂浠ｈ〃杩涙鍏氾紝鍙堝悕鍏箍鍏氾紝鍐嶆绔為�夋�荤粺銆傚湪瀵嗗皵娌冨熀锛岀綏鏂鍦ㄥ嵆灏嗗彂琛ㄦ紨璁叉椂涓脊銆傝鍦ㄨ。鏈嶅彛琚嬮噷鐨勬紨璁茬ǹ鍑忕紦浜嗗瓙寮瑰甫鏉ョ殑鍐插嚮锛屾晳浜嗕粬涓�鍛姐�備粬蹇嶇棝鍙戣〃浜嗘紨璁层�傝櫧鐒舵紨璁茶缂╃煭浜嗭紝缃楁柉绂忎粛鐒惰〃绀衡�滆繖涓嶈冻浠ユ潃姝讳竴鍙叕楣库�濄��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滀粬璁や负濡傛灉鍘诲尰闄㈠苟琛ㄧ幇鍑鸿櫄寮辩殑鏍峰瓙锛屼究浼氶檷浣庝粬鑾疯儨鐨勫彲鑳芥�э紝鈥濆竷鏋楀厠鍒╄鍒扮綏鏂鏃惰〃绀恒�傛渶缁堬紝缃楁柉绂忓湪閭ｄ竴灞婇�変妇涓触鍖椼��\r\n\r\n\r\n浼嶅痉缃椔峰▉灏旈��\r\n\r\n\r\n1919骞达紝浼嶅痉缃椔峰▉灏旈�婃�荤粺(Woodrow Wilson)涓锛岃韩浣撹櫄寮便�備腑椋庡鑷翠粬澶卞幓琛屽姩鑳藉姏锛屽苟寮曞彂浜嗙枒闂紝浜轰滑璐ㄧ枒鍒板簳鏄皝鐪熸鍦ㄩ瀵兼斂搴溿��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍖呮嫭绁炵粡绮剧鐥呭瀹跺焹寰锋俯路A路闊︽仼鏂芥嘲鍥�(Edwin A.
