New Jersey native, Frances Chan, who is 5'2\" and weighs 90lbs, claims she's been force feeding herself Cheetos and ice cream in an attempt to add flesh to her tiny frame after the Ivy League school became convinced she was suffering from an eating disorder.\n　　耶鲁大学向学生弗朗西丝-陈提出了劝退警告，因为她太瘦了。今年20岁的弗朗西丝-陈是新泽西当地人，耶鲁大学历史学专业学生，身高5英尺2英寸(约1.57米)、体重90磅(约40.8公斤)。陈说这所常春藤名校称她饮食失衡，强制要求她增肥，所以她不得不强迫自己吃奇多和冰淇淋，只希望给自己的小身体长点肉。\n耶鲁女生太瘦被学校警告：我只是天生苗条\n　　Chan said the college wouldn't even let up when her parents confirmed she, and the rest of her family, had always been naturally skinny and even sent in childhood medical records and had their doctor contact the school.\n　　陈说她的家长向学校证实她们一家人都自然偏瘦，甚至还把她童年的医疗记录寄到学校、并请家庭医生联系了校方，但学校还是不肯让步。\n　　'It felt really bad to be this powerless,' Chan told the New Haven Register. 'I ate ice cream twice a day. I ate cookies. I used elevators instead of walking up stairs. But I don't really gain any weight.'\n　　“我感到如此无力、非常糟糕!” 陈告诉《纽黑文记事报》的记者，“我每天吃两次冰淇淋，还吃许多甜点，并且用电梯代替走步，可是我就是很难增重。”\n　　She said the battle over her weight began in September when she noticed a lump in her breast and went to get it checked out. The lump came back benign, but Yale doctors called her in for a follow up appointment because they had other 'concerns.'\n　　她说，去年九月她发现自己胸部有肿块，于是去看了校园医生。检查结果表明肿块是良性的，但后来耶鲁医生约她再次前往就诊，因为他们“有别的担心”。于是，针对她体重过轻的争论开始了。\n　　In the meeting, they told her she was dangerously underweight and imposed mandatory weekly weigh-ins as well as sessions with a mental health professional and a nutritionist.\n　　在会诊中，校医说她体重严重过轻，并强制她每周增重，同时辅助以心理专家和营养师辅导。\n　　Chan tried to comply with the school's request and put on weight but she only managed to gain two pounds. However, the university said that wouldn't do.\n　　陈曾试图遵从学校的要求努力增重，但是她勉强增了2磅(0.9公斤)。然而学校却说这样还是不行。\n　　Angry, helpless and distracted from her studies, Chan decided to pen an essay about her experience for the Huffington Post. In it she explains that she's been small 'since high school, but it has never led to any illnesses related to low weight or malnutrition.'\n　　陈既生气又无助，无心学习，于是决定执笔把自己的经历写给《赫芬顿邮报》。她在文章中说，她“自从中学就体型娇小，但从来没有因为体重过轻、营养不良而生病。\n　　She claims the university's blind use of Body Mass Index as a yard stick for a healthy weight is where they are going wrong.\n　　她说耶鲁大学的错误就在于，盲目使用身体质量指数作为衡量健康的标准。\n　　On Friday, she learned that her new doctor acknowledged BMI was not the only measure of a healthy weight and admitted the college had 'made a mistake' in how they handled her thin frame.\n　　周五，陈从自己的新任医生那里了解到，身体质量指数不是衡量健康体重的标准，学校在对于她“过轻”体重那些处理方法确实“犯了个错误”。"
