"Tests commonly recommended to screen healthy women for ovarian cancer do more harm than good and should not be performed, a panel of medical experts said on Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe screenings 鈥� blood tests for a substance linked to cancer, and ultrasound scans to examine the ovaries 鈥� do not lower the death rate from the disease, and yield many false-positive results that lead to unnecessary operations with high complication rates, the panel said.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淭here is no existing method of screening for ovarian cancer that is effective in reducing deaths,鈥� Dr. Virginia Moyer, the chairwoman of the expert panel, said in a statement from the group, the United States Preventive Services Task Force. 鈥淚n fact, a high percentage of women who undergo screening experience false-positive test results and consequently may be subjected to unnecessary harms, such as major surgery.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advice against testing applies only to healthy women with an average risk of ovarian cancer, not to those with suspicious symptoms and not to women at high risk because they carry certain genetic mutations or have a family history of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recommendations are just the latest in a series of challenges to cancer screening issued by the group, which has also rejected PSA screening for prostate cancer in men and routine mammograms in women under 50. The task force is a group of 16 experts, appointed by the government but independent, that makes recommendations about screening tests and other efforts to prevent disease. Its advice is based on medical evidence, not cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recommendations against screening for ovarian cancer are being published on Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine. The warning is not new 鈥� the panel is reaffirming its own earlier advice. And though the task force has sometimes drawn fire in the past, particularly with its stand on mammograms, in this case it has plenty of support. Other medical groups, including the American Cancer Society and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have for years been discouraging tests to screen for ovarian cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut some doctors continue to recommend screening anyway, and patients request it, clinging to the mistaken belief that the tests can somehow find the disease early enough to save lives. A report published in February in Annals of Internal Medicine, based on a survey of 1,088 doctors, said that about a third of them believed the screening was effective and that many routinely offered it to patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淲e are fueled by hope,鈥� Dr. Moyer said. \r\n\r\n\r\nOvarian cancer is among the more rapidly fatal forms of cancer. In most cases, it is already advanced by the time it is diagnosed. Doctors say the only advice they can give women is not to ignore symptoms that may be the first warning of the disease: persistent bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, feeling full early while eating and needing to urinate frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor its latest recommendations, the panel relied heavily on a large study published last year in The Journal of the American American Medical Association of 78,216 women from 55 to 74. Half got screening and half did not, and they were followed for 11 to 13 years. The screening consisted of ultrasound exams and blood tests for elevated levels of substance called CA-125, which can be a sign of ovarian cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no advantage to screening: the death rate from ovarian cancer was the same in the two groups. But among the women who were screened, nearly 10 percent 鈥� 3,285 women 鈥� had false positive results. Of those women with false positives, 1,080 had surgery, usually to remove one or both ovaries. Only after the operations were done was it clear that they had been unnecessary. And at least 15 percent of the women who had surgery had at least one serious complication, like blood clots, infections or surgical injuries to other organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find one case of ovarian cancer, 20 women had to undergo surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem with the tests is that CA-125 can be elevated by conditions other than cancer, and ultrasound can reveal ovarian enlargement or cysts that are benign but that cannot distinguished from cancer without surgery to take out the ovary.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Barbara A. Goff, a gynecologic oncologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, said: 鈥淚f patients request it, then I think a lot of times physicians feel it鈥檚 just easier to order the test, particularly if it鈥檚 covered by insurance, rather than taking the time to explain why it may not be good, that it could lead to inappropriate surgery, could lead to harm. I don鈥檛 think they think through the consequences.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is often easier, she said, to talk patients into surgery than to talk them out of an operation or test they have set their minds on.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Edward E. Partridge, director of the cancer center at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said that even if the testing could be improved to reduce false positives, it still would not save women鈥檚 lives. Even with the false positives eliminated, the fact remains that the death rate from the cancer was the same whether women were screened or not, suggesting that the test simply could not find the cancer early enough to make a difference.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Partridge said: 鈥淚 think it鈥檚 really important that both the physician and the public really learn and assimilate that this test as it鈥檚 currently delivered is not effective at reducing death rates from ovarian cancer. We鈥檝e got to find something else.鈥�\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�3鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圖ENISE GRADY锛�\r\n鏈懆涓�锛屼竴涓尰瀛︿笓瀹跺皬缁勭О锛岄�氬父鎺ㄨ崘鐨勫仴搴峰コ鎬у嵉宸㈢檶绛涙煡寮婂ぇ浜庡埄锛屼笉搴旇繘琛岃繖鏍风殑妫�鏌ャ��\r\n\r\n\r\n涓撳灏忕粍琛ㄧず锛岃繖椤圭瓫鏌ワ紙閫氳繃楠岃妫�娴嬩竴绉嶈偪鐦ゆ爣蹇楃墿锛屼互鍙婇�氳繃瓒呭０娉㈡壂鎻忔鏌ュ嵉宸級骞舵湭闄嶄綆鍗靛发鐧岀殑姝讳骸鐜囷紝鑰屼笖寰堝妫�鏌ョ粨鏋滄槸鍋囬槼鎬х殑锛岃繖瀵艰嚧鎮ｈ�呮帴鍙椾笉蹇呰鐨勬墜鏈紝鑰屼笖鎵嬫湳鐨勫苟鍙戠棁鍙戠敓鐜囧緢楂樸��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滅洰鍓嶆病鏈夊摢绉嶇瓫鏌ュ嵉宸㈢檶鐨勬柟娉曞湪鍑忓皯姝讳骸鐜囨柟闈㈡槸鏈夋晥鐨勶紝鈥濊鍖诲涓撳灏忕粍鈥斺�旂編鍥介闃叉湇鍔″伐浣滅粍(United States Preventive Services Task Force)涓诲腑銆佸紬鍚夊凹浜毬疯帿鑰�(Virginia Moyer)鍖荤敓鍦ㄤ竴浠藉０鏄庝腑琛ㄧず锛屸�滃疄闄呬笂锛屾帴鍙楃瓫鏌ョ殑濂虫�т腑锛屾湁鐩稿綋楂樻瘮渚嬪緱鍒板亣闃虫�х殑妫�鏌ョ粨鏋滐紝鏈�缁堝彲鑳芥壙鍙椾笉蹇呰鐨勪激瀹筹紝姣斿澶ф墜鏈�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n鍙嶅妫�鏌ョ殑寤鸿锛屽彧閫傜敤浜庡叿鏈変竴鑸嵉宸㈢檶椋庨櫓鐨勫仴搴峰コ鎬э紝鑰屼笉閫傜敤浜庨偅浜涘甫鏈夊彲鐤戠棁鐘躲�佹垨鏈夐珮鍗靛发鐧岄闄╋紙鍥犱负濂逛滑鎼哄甫浜嗘煇浜涘熀鍥犵獊鍙樸�佹垨鏈夊鏃忕梾鍙诧級鐨勫コ鎬с��\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欐槸璇ュ皬缁勫彂甯冪殑鍙嶅鐧岀棁绛涙煡鐨勪竴绯诲垪寤鸿涓殑鏈�鏂板缓璁�傛鍓嶈灏忕粍鏇惧弽瀵圭敺鎬ф帴鍙楀墠鍒楄吅鐧岀壒寮傛�ф姉鍘�(PSA)绛涙煡锛屼互鍙�50宀佷互涓嬪コ鎬ф帴鍙椾緥琛屼钩鎴縓鍏夋鏌ャ�傝繖涓伐浣滅粍鐢辨斂搴滀换鍛斤紙浣嗕繚鎸佺嫭绔嬶級鐨�16鍚嶄笓瀹剁粍鎴愶紝璐熻矗涓虹瓫鏌ユ娴嬪拰鍏朵粬鐤剧梾棰勯槻宸ヤ綔鎻愪緵寤鸿銆傚叾寤鸿寤虹珛鍦ㄥ尰瀛﹁瘉鎹紙鑰岄潪鎴愭湰锛夌殑鍩虹涓娿��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍙嶅鍗靛发鐧岀瓫鏌ョ殑寤鸿鍙戣〃鍦ㄥ懆涓�鐨勩�婂唴绉戝尰瀛﹀勾閴淬��(Annals of Internal Medicine)涓娿�傝繖涓鍛婂苟涓嶆柊锛涜灏忕粍鍙槸鍦ㄩ噸鐢冲叾鏃╁厛鐨勫缓璁�傚敖绠¤繖涓伐浣滅粍鏇惧湪杩囧幓鎷涜嚧鎵硅瘎锛屽挨鍏舵槸瀹冨湪涔虫埧X鍏夋鏌ヤ笂鐨勭珛鍦猴紝浣嗗畠鍦ㄥ嵉宸㈢檶绛涙煡闂涓婂緱鍒板箍娉涙敮鎸併�傚叾浠栧尰瀛︾粍缁囷紝鍖呮嫭缇庡浗鐧岀棁鍗忎細(American Cancer Society)鍜岀編鍥藉浜х鍖诲笀瀛︿細(ACOG)锛屽骞存潵涓�鐩村弽瀵瑰嵉宸㈢檶绛涙煡銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗘槸锛屼竴浜涘尰鐢熻繕鏄户缁帹鑽愯繘琛岃繖椤圭瓫鏌ワ紝鎮ｈ�呬篃鏈夎繖鏍风殑瑕佹眰锛岄敊璇湴鐩镐俊妫�鏌ヨ兘鍙婃棭鍙戠幇鐤剧梾锛屾尳鏁戠敓鍛姐�傘�婂唴绉戝尰瀛﹀勾閴淬�嬩粖骞�2鏈堝彂琛ㄤ簡娑夊強1088鍚嶅尰鐢熺殑璋冩煡鎶ュ憡銆傛姤鍛婄О锛岀害鏈変笁鍒嗕箣涓�鐨勫尰鐢熺浉淇＄瓫鏌ユ槸鏈夋晥鐨勶紝鑰屼笖璁稿鍖荤敓缁忓父鍚戞偅鑰呮帹鑽愮瓫鏌ャ��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滄垜浠彈鍒板笇鏈涚殑椹变娇锛屸�濊帿鑰跺尰鐢熻閬撱��\r\n\r\n\r\n寮楀悏灏间簹路鑾�跺崥澹О锛岀洰鍓嶆病鏈夊摢绉嶇瓫鏌ュ嵉宸㈢檶鐨勬柟娉曡兘鏈夋晥闄嶄綆姝讳骸鐜囥�� \r\n\r\n\r\n鍗靛发鐧屾槸杈冨揩鑷村懡鐨勭檶鐥囦箣涓�銆傚湪澶у鏁扮梾渚嬩腑锛屽緱鍒扮‘璇婄殑鎮ｈ�呭凡澶勪簬鐧岀棁鏅氭湡銆傚尰鐢熶滑璇达紝浠栦滑鑳界粰濂虫�ф彁渚涚殑鍞竴寤鸿灏辨槸锛屼笉瑕佸拷瑙嗛偅浜涘彲鑳芥槸鍗靛发鐧屾渶鍒濊鍛婄殑鐥囩姸锛氭寔缁吂鑳�銆侀鐩嗘垨鑵归儴鐤肩棝銆佽繘椋熸椂寰堝揩灏辨湁楗辫儉鎰燂紝浠ュ強闇�瑕侀绻佸皬渚裤��\r\n\r\n\r\n璇ュ皬缁勭殑鏈�鏂板缓璁湪寰堝ぇ绋嬪害涓婁緷璧栧幓骞村彂琛ㄥ湪銆婄編鍥藉尰瀛﹀崗浼氭湡鍒娿��(JAMA)涓婄殑涓�椤瑰ぇ瑙勬ā鐮旂┒锛岃鐮旂┒鐨勫璞℃槸78216鍚嶅勾榫勫湪55宀佸拰74宀佷箣闂寸殑濂虫�э紝鍏朵腑涓�鍗婁汉鎺ュ彈绛涙煡锛岃�屽彟涓�鍗婁汉涓嶆帴鍙楃瓫鏌ワ紝瀵瑰ス浠窡韪爺绌�11骞村埌13骞淬�傜瓫鏌ュ寘鎷秴澹版尝妫�鏌ュ拰楠岃锛堟娴嬭娑蹭腑CA-125鐨勬按骞虫槸鍚﹀亸楂橈紝杩欏彲鑳芥槸鍗靛发鐧岀殑鏍囧織锛夈��\r\n\r\n\r\n绛涙煡骞舵湭甯︽潵浼樺娍锛氫袱缁勭爺绌跺璞＄殑鍗靛发鐧屾浜＄巼鐩稿悓銆備絾鍦ㄦ帴鍙楃瓫鏌ョ殑濂虫�т腑锛屾湁灏嗚繎10%锛堝嵆3285鍚嶅コ鎬э級鐨勪汉寰楀埌鍋囬槼鎬х殑妫�鏌ョ粨鏋滐紝鍏朵腑1080浜烘帴鍙椾簡鎵嬫湳锛岄�氬父鏄憳闄や竴渚ф垨鍙屼晶鐨勫嵉宸€�傚彧鏄湪鎵嬫湳瀹屾垚鍚庢墠鍙戠幇鎵嬫湳骞舵棤蹇呰銆傝�屼笖鍦ㄦ帴鍙楁墜鏈殑濂虫�т腑鑷冲皯鏈�15%鍑虹幇浜嗚嚦灏戜竴绉嶄弗閲嶅苟鍙戠棁锛屽儚琛�鏍撱�佹劅鏌擄紝鎴栧叾浠栧櫒瀹樺彈鍒版墜鏈崯浼ゃ��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦�20鍚嶆帴鍙楁墜鏈殑濂虫�т腑锛屽彧浼氬彂鐜颁竴鍚嶅嵉宸㈢檶鎮ｈ�呫��\r\n\r\n\r\n妫�鏌ョ殑闂鏄紝鐧岀棁浠ュ鐨勫叾浠栫梾鐥囦篃鍙兘璁〤A-125鐨勬按骞充笂鍗囷紝瓒呭０娉㈠彲鑳芥樉绀哄嵉宸㈣偉澶ф垨鑹�у泭鑲匡紝浣嗗彧鏈夐�氳繃鎵嬫湳鍙栧嚭鍗靛发鎵嶈兘杈ㄥ埆鏄惁鏄檶鐥囥��\r\n\r\n\r\n瑗块泤鍥惧紬闆峰痉鍝堥挦妫檶鐥囩爺绌朵腑蹇�(Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center)鐨勫绉戣偪鐦や笓瀹惰姯鑺媺路A路鎴堝か(Barbara A.
