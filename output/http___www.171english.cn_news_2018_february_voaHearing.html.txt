If the person fails to appear in court, he forfeits the bond.\r\nThe decision also affects asylees and permanent legal residents, who can now be detained indefinitely until they have an immigration court hearing. \r\n\"Today's decision means they can't apply for bond while they are waiting for their day in immigration court,\" Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York, told VOA. \r\nYale-Loehr said the current backlog for immigration hearings is almost two years. This decision, he said, is \"bad news\" for immigrant detainees. \r\n\"More [immigrants] will be detained longer without the right to apply to be released on bond,\" Yale-Loehr said. \"Today's decision impacts detained noncitizens' constitutional rights and their ability to exercise their legal rights during deportation proceedings.\"\r\nDepartment of Justice spokesman Devin O'Malley said the change was a \"commonsense reform\" that reduced the number of \"unnecessary bond hearings\" that \"burdened\" the immigration court system. \r\nThe decision reversed the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said detained immigrants have a right to a bond hearing every six months while they are being detained. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from the case. She was solicitor general in the Obama administration when this case was argued in the court.\r\nAccording to NPR, the Supreme Court was deadlocked on the case before Neil Gorsuch joined the court."
