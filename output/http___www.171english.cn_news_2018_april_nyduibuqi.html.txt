These apologies are easy and usually readily accepted, often with a response like, 鈥淣o problem.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when 鈥淚鈥檓 sorry鈥� are the words needed to right truly hurtful words, acts or inaction, they can be the hardest ones to utter. And even when an apology is offered with the best of intentions, it can be seriously undermined by the way in which it is worded. Instead of eradicating the emotional pain the affront caused, a poorly worded apology can result in lasting anger and antagonism, and undermine an important relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\nI admit to a lifetime of challenges when it comes to apologizing, especially when I thought I was right or misunderstood or that the offended party was being overly sensitive. But I recently discovered that the need for an apology is less about me than the person who, for whatever reason, is offended by something I said or did or failed to do, regardless of my intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also learned that a sincere apology can be powerful medicine with surprising value for the giver as well as the recipient.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter learning that a neighbor who had assaulted me verbally was furious about an oversight I had not known I committed, I wrote a letter in hopes of defusing the hostility. Without offering any excuses, I apologized for my lapse in etiquette and respect. I said I was not asking for or expecting forgiveness, merely that I hoped we could have a civil, if not friendly, relationship going forward, then delivered the letter with a jar of my homemade jam.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpecting nothing in return, I was greatly relieved when my doorbell rang and the neighbor thanked me warmly for what I had said and done. My relief was palpable. I felt as if I鈥檇 not only discarded an enemy but made a new friend, which is indeed how it played out in the days that followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a week later I learned that, according to the psychologist and author Harriet Lerner, the wording of my apology was just what the 鈥渄octor鈥� would have ordered. In the very first chapter of her new book, 鈥淲hy Won鈥檛 You Apologize?鈥� Lerner points out that apologies followed by rationalizations are 鈥渘ever satisfying鈥� and can even be harmful.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淲hen 鈥榖ut鈥� is tagged on to an apology,鈥� she wrote, it鈥檚 an excuse that counters the sincerity of the original message. The best apologies are short and don鈥檛 include explanations that can undo them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor should a request for forgiveness be part of an apology. The offended party may accept a sincere apology but still be unready to forgive the transgression. Forgiveness, should it come, may depend on a demonstration going forward that the offense will not be repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淚t鈥檚 not our place to tell anyone to forgive or not to forgive,鈥� Lerner said in an interview. She disputes popular thinking that failing to forgive is bad for one鈥檚 health and can lead to a life mired in bitterness and hate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffering an apology is an admission of guilt that admittedly leaves people vulnerable. There鈥檚 no guarantee as to how it will be received. It is the prerogative of the injured party to reject an apology, even when sincerely offered. The person may feel the offense was so enormous 鈥� for example, having been sexually abused by a parent 鈥� that it is impossible to accept a mea culpa offered by the abusive parent years later.\r\n\r\n\r\nRighting a perceived wrong can be especially challenging when it involves family members, who may be inclined to cite history 鈥� he was abused by his father, or she was raised by a distant mother 鈥� as an excuse for hurtful behavior. 鈥淗istory can be used as an explanation, not an excuse,鈥� the psychologist said. 鈥淚t should involve a conversation that allows the hurt party to express anger and pain if an apology, however sincere, is to heal a broken connection.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nAs she wrote: 鈥淣ondefensive listening (to the hurt party) is at the heart of offering a sincere apology.鈥� She urges the listener not to 鈥渋nterrupt, argue, refute, or correct facts, or bring up your own criticisms and complaints.鈥� Even when the offended party is largely at fault, she suggests apologizing for one鈥檚 own part in the incident, however small it may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nLerner views apology as 鈥渃entral to health, both physical and emotional. 鈥業鈥檓 sorry鈥� are the two most healing words in the English language,鈥� she said. 鈥淭he courage to apologize wisely and well is not just a gift to the injured person, who can then feel soothed and released from obsessive recriminations, bitterness and corrosive anger. It鈥檚 also a gift to one鈥檚 own health, bestowing self-respect, integrity and maturity 鈥� an ability to take a cleareyed look at how our behavior affects others and to assume responsibility for acting at another person鈥檚 expense.鈥�"
