Outgoing President Barack Obama, who ordered the report, was briefed on the material Thursday.\r\nIn the report, both the CIA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation state they have “high confidence” in their conclusions. A third intelligence branch, the National Security Agency, while in agreement, said it has only “moderate” confidence in the findings.Late Friday, Trump posted a tweet that blames the Democrats for being hacked. \"Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place,\" Trump tweeted. \"The Republican National Committee had strong defense.\"\r\nTrump furthered his criticism in a pair of tweets Saturday morning, pointing out that the hacking didn't change any votes and calling democrats \"totally embarrassed\" by their election loss.\r\n“Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched,” Trump tweeted. “Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!”"
