"This year, resolve to drop your daily deal habit. Buying coupons can be extremely addictive, because sometimes the deals are just too tempting. But oftentimes, you'll end up doing something that you never planned on doing in the first place and trying restaurants that you had no intention of trying to begin with. The problem is that you might forget about them if you're not carefully keeping track of them, and you may end up losing money when the coupon expires.\n　　今年要下决心戒掉每天买东西的习惯。买抵用券会上瘾，因为有时候商品太诱惑人了。但结果是你经常会做本来不准备做的事，去本来不想去的餐馆。问题在于如果你不够细心能想起这些抵用券，你很可能会忘记它们，而且当抵用券快到期时，你的钱包可要遭罪了。\n　　Do yourself and your budget a favor this year, and unsubscribe from all the daily deals sites except your all-time favorite. I know there may be deals that seem too good to miss out on, so limit yourself to buying one or two online coupons this year. If you're worried about missing out on an amazing deal, I'm sure you'll catch wind of it through friends or social media. And if you miss one, either scout for it on sites that sell unused daily deals or patiently wait for it to show up again.\n　　今年让你自己和开支预算都轻松些吧，除了你一直喜欢的东西，注销所有“每日购物精品”网站的账号。我明白有些商品很棒，错过了很可惜，所以今年可以限制自己买一到两张网购打折券。如果你担心错过好商品，我相信你从社交网络和朋友那里也会得到消息的。如果你真的错失了机会，你可以在卖二手货的网站上找找(类似的商品)，或者耐心等待它再次出现。"
