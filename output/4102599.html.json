The exam has long been controversial for imposing uniformity in picking talents. Do students in other countries have to suffer similar pressures to win university places? Let's have a look.\n　　对中国许多想接受高等教育的学生来说，6月7日是个大日子，因为这是高考的第一天。长久以来，高考制度因其单一的人才选拔制度而饱受争议，那么其他国家的学生是否也需要承担如此压力才能进入心仪的大学呢?让我们一起来看看吧。\n　　1.Each year, millions of Chinese sit the exam which is held normally on June 7-8.\n　　每年6月7、8日两天，中国数百万的学生参加高考。\n　　It is taken by students in their final year of senior high school without age restriction. Last year 9.12 million students took the exam. Although university admission is rising, with more than 90 percent in some provinces, to enter a good university one still needs go through fierce competition.\n　　高考在学生高三最后学年结束时举行，去年有912万考生应考。尽管高考的大学录取率在提高，有些省份高达90%以上，但想要进入一个理想的好大学还是要经过高考的激烈竞争。2. The American College Testing assessment (ACT) and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) are the two main college entrance exams administered in the United States.\n　　ACT美国大学入学考试和SAT美国高考，是美国施行的两种主要高校入学考试。\n　　While the SAT measures a student's ability to learn, the ACT was created as an alternative, measuring a student's educational development. Although many US colleges accept both exams, most students take the ACT. Each year nearly two million students pay a registration fee of about $50 to take the test, which is administered six times throughout the year. Students can also retake the exam for a better score.\n　　SAT考查学生的学习能力，而ACT作为一门自选考试、考查学生的教育发展能力。虽然美国大多数大学对两种考试都持认可态度，但大部分学生参加ACT考试。每年有将近2000万考生支付50美元的报考费，一年有6次报考机会。学生可以重复参加考试以获取成绩。3. The United Kingdom does not have a specific standardized test for determining college admission.\n　　英国没有统一的大学入学标准考试。\n　　Instead, each college sets up its own admissions criteria, which often only involves submission of transcripts and participation in an interview. There are subject-specific exams used by some colleges, but they are not as comprehensive as tests like the ACT and gaokao. High school academic performance is by far the main determining factor, rather than test scores or other credentials.\n　　替而代之的，每个大学都有自己的考核标准，有些只需上交成绩单并进行一场面试就可以了。有些大学采用针对学科的考试，但这些考试都不像ACT和高考那么综合全面。目前，中学的学习成绩是英国大学录取的主要因素，而不是仅凭某一考试分数或其他证书。4.The so-called college entrance examination is equal to the baccalaureate in June in France.\n　　法国6月份的毕业考和所谓的“高考”等同。\n　　Students interested in higher education have to choose between two types of educational institutes: Universities and Competitive Institutes (Grandes Ecoles). French universities are open to all students who have passed their baccalaureate. But getting into a \"grande école\" is a whole different game where entry is at \"bac+2\" level, the level of the third year of university studies.\n　　对高等教育有兴趣的同学可以选择两种学校就读：大学或有竞争力的学院(法国“大学校”)。法国大学对所有通过毕业考的学生开放，但想进入“大学校”则有不同的准入规则，入学的学生必须达到bac+2水平，等同于大学三年级的水平。5.In Japan there is a National Center Test for University Admissions, a standardized test used by public and some private universities.\n　　日本则为大学准入安排了全国性大学入学考试，其标准化考试为众多公立和私立大学所采纳。\n　　Because students only have one chance to take the test each year, there is great pressure to perform well and the majority of senior high school education is devoted to this single test. This year, 561,000 students sat the entrance examination in January.\n　　由于学生每年只有一次机会参加考试，所以要一次考好就会给学生很大压力，进而日本高中教育的重点都是为了这一场考试。今年1月，日本有561000学生参加大学入学考试。6.College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) or college entrance exam is held in November each year in South Korea.\n　　每年11月份，韩国都要举行大学修学能力测试(CSAT)或者大学入学考试。\n　　CSAT plays an important role in the country's education and it is commonly believed that the test paves the way and life of most high school graduates. On the test day, the stock markets open late and buses and subways are increased to avoid traffic jams that may prevent students from getting to testing sites. Students who are late for the tests are escorted by police officers.\n　　CSAT在韩国的教育中扮演着重要角色，通常认为这场考试决定着大部分高中毕业生的前途和命运。在考试这一天，股票市场开盘推迟、公车地铁班次增加以避免交通堵塞，这一切都是为保证学生能准时到达考场。有迟到危险的考生还会得到交警的护送。"
