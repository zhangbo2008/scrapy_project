"The Slow Eater\n　　慢食者\n　　After everyone else has finished their meal, you'll find this person plodding along, eating one little bite at a time. When sitting down at the table, the slow eater takes his or her sweet time -- and is always the last person to finish the meal.\n　　大家都吃完饭了，你会发觉这人还在慢吞吞地进食，每次就吃一小口。慢食者坐下吃饭时，尽享美好时光――也总是最后一个吃完的人。\n　　Slow eaters are usually people who like to be in control and know how to appreciate life. They also tend to be confident and even-keeled. There are some real health perks to being a slow eater. Slow eating has been shown to be associated with decreased energy intake, increased satiety, and higher pleasantness ratings of meals.\n　　慢食者通常喜欢把控，也知道如何感激生活。他们通常自信满满、四平八稳。当个慢食者真真切切有益健康。据悉，慢食者能量摄入少、更容易满足，对菜肴评价也更高。\n　　The Fast Eater\n　　快食者\n　　There's a good chance you or someone else in your family fits the description of the fast eater -- and if you grew up with a fast eater, you probably developed a habit of fighting for seconds. This person tends to barrel through meals, cleaning the plate before the rest of the table has finished even half of their meal.\n　　很有可能在你家，你自己或者其他人就符合快食者的形象描述――而且，要是你和一个快食者一起长大，你估计已经养成了吃饭争分夺秒的习惯。这个人通常就餐时囫囵吞枣、匆匆下饭，同桌人饮食饭菜一半还没吃完，他就已经净盘了。\n　　Away from the table, fast eaters tend to be ambitious, goal-oriented and open to new experiences, but they may also have a tendency to be impatient.\n　　餐桌之外，快食者更有可能雄心勃勃，目标明确，乐于经历新事物，但他们也通常容易急不可耐。\n　　The Adventurer\n　　冒险者\n　　The adventurous eater is always looking for the next gastronomic adventure. When it comes to food -- and probably other areas of life -- this person is a thrill-seeker and a risk-taker.\n　　冒险型食客总是在寻求下一场美食历险。论及食物，或者生活中其他领域，这样的人寻求刺激、承担风险。\n　　Being an adventurous eater shows one's openness to trying new things outside of one's comfort zone.\n　　当个冒险食客，显示出一个人乐于尝试新事物，敢于迈出自己的舒适地带。\n　　The Picky Eater\n　　挑食者\n　　This person may never have grown out of their childhood likes and dislikes, or the tendency to turn up his or her nose at an unfamiliar cuisine. This eater can often be found asking a waiter if the dish can be served without sauce or with dressing on the side.\n　　这类人或许从来就没有走出孩童时代的喜好，容易对不熟悉的菜肴嗤之以鼻。常常会看见这样的食客问服务员这菜可不可以不加酱料就端上来，或者把调味料加在一边。\n　　Research on 'food neophobia' -- the reluctance to try new foods -- shows that it is related to certain personality traits, including sensation seeking, anxiety, and neuroticism. Those high in food neophobia appear to associate many avoided foods with a sense of disgust.\n　　“新食物恐惧症”――即不乐意尝试新食物是研究发现：这和特定的性格特征有关，如寻求感官刺激、易焦虑和神经过敏等。新食物恐惧症高发人群易于把规避的食物和嫌恶联系在一起。\n　　The Isolationist\n　　孤立主义食客\n　　The isolationist, one of the more unusual eating types, approaches the plate methodically, eating one food item in its entirety before moving on to the next.\n　　孤立主义者是更为鲜见的饮食类型，有条不紊地进食，完全吃完一种食物才接着吃下一种。\n　　This behavior conveys a task-oriented personality versus a multi-tasking individual. Also, it conveys a disciplined and border-line stubborn tendency to complete one task before moving on to another.\n　　这种行为习惯体现了任务为导向的性格，而非多任务作业的个体性格。此外，这体现出纪律严明、界限分明、执拗固执的行为趋向，得完成了一项任务后才能继续下一项任务。"
