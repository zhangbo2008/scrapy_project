As one of the volunteers at this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, he assists more than 100 international delegates all from the information desk of Beijing Hotel.\n作为2014亚太经合组织（APEC）第三次高官会议的一名志愿者，“谢谢您”、“请……”等词已经成了纳跃刚的口头禅。在北京饭店的咨询台，他为100多名国际代表提供帮助。\nBut Na Yuegang is not alone. More than 600 volunteers from 13 universities in Beijing contribute to the APEC meeting, according to Beijing Daily.\n而纳跃刚并不是一个人，据《北京日报》报道，来自北京13所高校的600多名志愿者为此次APEC会议提供服务。\nStudents take advantage of opportunities to put their skills and interests to work at the forum, and in return they gain valuable work experience and connections.\n在此次会议中，大学生们有机会学以致用、做自己喜爱的工作，同时，也收获了有价值的工作经历和人脉关系。\nLanguage expert\n语言“发烧友”\nNa Yuegang is an international politics major at Beijing Language and Culture University, and he’s a language enthusiast. In addition to English, he speaks both Thai and Cantonese. He uses his talents to help determine where delegates are from based on their accents.\n纳跃刚在北京语言大学就读国际政治专业，他是一名语言“发烧友”。除了英语，他还会说泰语和粤语，因此他能通过代表们的口音判断他们来自哪里。\nHe even gets to use his language skills to communicate with staffers.

She is also in charge of showing off cultural relics like cloisonné metallurgy, and she does it all in English.\n来自北京工业大学英语专业的21岁的徐晗则从另一个角度接触了此次会议。她的工作是用英语向代表团介绍中国科技发明，比如科技公司Tiertime制造的3D打印机；以及中国文化遗产景泰蓝工艺等。\nOnce a Thai delegate showed tremendous interest in the process behind a carved lacquerware technique, but Xu Han wasn’t familiar with the subject.\n一次，一位泰国代表对雕漆技术兴趣浓厚，可徐晗对此并不熟悉。\nEven so, she did a lot of preparation for the work.

She originally knew very little about traditional Chinese artifacts, but through her own research she’s gained the ability to speak about the subject with confidence.\n此外，她还做了一些在线研究。原本对中国传统手工艺品知之甚少的她，现在已经能够自信地对这些工艺品侃侃而谈了。\nShe’s constantly on the lookout for opportunities to grow. “I still read about Chinese culture,” she says.\n徐晗一直在寻求不断进步的机会，她说“我还在阅读一些关于中国文化的书籍。”\nBridging the language gap\n语言的桥梁\nExactly how delegates work during the APEC forum remains a mystery to most students. For Zuo Meng, 21, an international economics and trade student from the University of International Relations, the job is a chance to witness the forum firsthand.\nAPEC会议上代表们是怎么工作的？很多学生对此仍知之甚少。而来自北京外交学院国际经济与贸易专业21岁的左髟蛴谢会见证代表们的工作。\nShe volunteers in the APEC Secretariat helping delegates solve all sorts of logistical problems that arise during work, bridging communication between delegates and other staffers whose English isn’t quite perfect.\n她在APEC秘书处担任志愿者，为代表团解决所有后勤问题，是英语欠佳的组织人员与代表之间沟通的桥梁。\nThe hardworking nature of the delegates and the forum’s friendly atmosphere has impressed her most. At 7 am, when she arrives in the office, the Secretary-General is already hard at work.\n让她印象最深刻的就是努力工作的代表团和会议的友好氛围。每天早上7点，当她走进办公室的时候，勤奋的秘书长早已开始一天的工作。\n“Based on the meeting recordings and transcripts, it seems that he’s always very careful in his work,” she says.\n她说，“在做会议记录时，他总是十分仔细。”\n“I respect their professionalism and optimistic outlook on life, and I plan to take what I’ve learned from them into the future,” she says.\n她还说，“我十分敬佩他们的专业精神和乐观的生活态度，将来我也要向他们学习。”"
