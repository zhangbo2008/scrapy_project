Then every morning for the next two weeks, the study participants completed questionnaires on sexual function over the past 24 hours and sleep quality the night before, including how long it took to fall asleep and total sleep time. The study is online in The Journal of Sexual Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn women who were in romantic relationships, each extra hour of sleep corresponded to higher levels of sexual desire, and a 14 percent increase in the likelihood of sexual activity the next day. Women with longer average sleep duration reported greater vaginal lubrication during sex than those with shorter average sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese effects persisted even after controlling for age, sexual distress, daytime feelings of happiness or sadness, fatigue and the presence of menstruation.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淕etting more sleep should not be expected to magically fix all sexual problems,鈥� said the lead author, David A. Kalmbach, a postdoctoral resident at the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淪exual problems often have multiple contributing factors, including mood, relationship quality, partner availability and, now we know, sleep health. I think it is important for women and health care professionals to be mindful of the relationship between sleep and sexual response.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圢ICHOLAS BAKALAR锛�\r\nA good night鈥檚 sleep may be important for a woman鈥檚 sex life, a small study suggests.\r\n\r\n\r\n涓�涓皬鐮旂┒琛ㄦ槑锛岃壇濂界殑澶滈棿鐫＄湢瀵逛簬濂虫�х殑鎬х敓娲诲彲鑳介潪甯搁噸瑕併��\r\n\r\n\r\nResearchers recruited 171 female college students, who completed well-validated questionnaires about sexual distress, depression and anxiety.
