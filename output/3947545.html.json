Designed by Hong Kong designer Ruan Hao, the wooden desk features tunnels and cavities for your cat to explore, keeping it distracted while you enjoy some kitty-free typing time.\n　　不过不必心烦，现在这里有一个解决方案：喵星人桌。香港设计师阮昊(Ruan Hao音译)设计了一款木制的工作台，里面有一些通道和洞洞，可以用来给喵星人探索，不断分散它们的注意力，这样你就可以尽情地享受没有猫咪打扰的打字时光了。\n　　The CATable was recently exhibited at the Milan Design Week furniture fair, and isn't yet available for purchase, which is the only downside to the whole thing. Perhaps it is time to pick up some carpentry skills as a hobby...\n　　这张喵星人桌最近在米兰设计周的家具展上展出，不过的不足是暂时还不能购买。也许是时候自己学点木工手艺作为兴趣爱好，给喵星人做一张了。"
