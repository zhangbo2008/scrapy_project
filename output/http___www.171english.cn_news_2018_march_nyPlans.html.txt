The timing, though, also appeared to be a warning shot against Mr. Trump鈥檚 latest action on the trade front, on Thursday, when he took specific aim at a much wider range of Chinese products.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese tariffs would 鈥渂alance out the losses sustained by China through the United States鈥� increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,鈥� an unnamed Commerce Ministry spokesman said in the statement. 鈥淐hina urges the United States to resolve China鈥檚 concerns as soon as possible, resolve bilateral differences through dialogue and consultation, and avoid damage to the broader array of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the planned Chinese countermeasures, American-produced fresh fruit, nuts, wine, seamless steel pipes and other goods would be the first to get hit, by 15 percent tariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Beijing feels necessary, another group of American-made goods would then draw 25 percent tariffs, including pork, which is a lucrative slice of United States exports to China. It said businesses and other parties had until March 31 to submit views about the retaliatory tariffs, meaning they would take effect only after that date.\r\n\r\n\r\nChina would also 鈥渢ake legal action within the framework of the World Trade Organization,鈥� the Commerce Ministry said.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe announcement, however, did not mention Mr. Trump鈥檚 latest round of tariffs aimed at Chinese-made goods, which the White House said Thursday was punishment for China鈥檚 use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotably, too, the list of 128 products that could be hurt by Chinese tariffs did not mention soybeans, smartphones or other electronic products, leaving open the possibility that they would be hit by another wave of Chinese retaliation in reaction to Mr. Trump鈥檚 latest tariffs, or set the stage for negotiations to avert a trade war.\r\n\r\n\r\nChina鈥檚 ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, said on Thursday that Beijing would retaliate against those tariffs on about $60 billion of Chinese goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淲e do not want a trade war with the United States or with anybody else, but we are not afraid of it,鈥� Mr. Cui said, according to Xinhua, the official news agency. 鈥淚f somebody tries to impose a trade war upon us, we will fight. We will do whatever we can to defend the legitimate interests.鈥�\r\n"
