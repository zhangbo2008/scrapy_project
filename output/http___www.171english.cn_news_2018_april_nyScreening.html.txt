"14 Million Visitors to U.S. Face Social Media Screening\r\nNearly all applicants for a visa to enter the United States 鈥� an estimated 14.7 million people a year 鈥� will be asked to submit their social media user names for the past five years, under proposed rules that the State Department issued on Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast September, the Trump administration announced that applicants for immigrant visas would be asked for social media data, a plan that would affect 710,000 people or so a year. The new proposal would vastly expand that order to cover some 14 million people each year who apply for nonimmigrant visas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal covers 20 social media platforms. Most of them are based in the United States: Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Myspace, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vine and YouTube. But several are based overseas: the Chinese sites Douban, QQ, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo and Youku; the Russian social network VK; Twoo, which was created in Belgium; and Ask.fm, a question-and-answer platform based in Latvia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his campaign, President Trump promised 鈥渆xtreme vetting鈥� of people seeking to enter the United States, and last March the State Department directed consular officers worldwide to step up scrutiny of visa applicants.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the new proposal would add a tangible new requirement for millions of people who apply to visit the United States for business or pleasure, including citizens of such countries as Brazil, China, India and Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens of roughly 40 countries to which the United States ordinarily grants visa-free travel will not be affected by the requirement. Those countries include major allies like Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and South Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, visitors traveling on diplomatic and official visas will mostly be exempted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs news of the plan emerged on Friday, so did criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淭his attempt to collect a massive amount of information on the social media activity of millions of visa applicants is yet another ineffective and deeply problematic Trump administration plan,鈥� said Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union鈥檚 National Security Project. 鈥淚t will infringe on the rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens by chilling freedom of speech and association, particularly because people will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nAnil Kalhan, an associate professor of law at Drexel University who works on immigration and international human rights, wrote on Twitter, 鈥淭his is unnecessarily intrusive and beyond ridiculous.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook said its position had not changed since last year, when it said: 鈥淲e oppose any efforts to force travelers at the border to turn over their private account information, including passwords.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with the social media information, visa applicants will be asked for past passport numbers, phone numbers and email addresses; for records of international travel; whether they have been deported or removed, or violated immigration law, in the past; and whether relatives have been involved in terrorist activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淢aintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,鈥� the State Department said in a statement. 鈥淲e already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nMillions of people each year complete the online application for a nonimmigrant visa, known as the DS-160. It takes about 90 minutes to fill out, according to the department.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack in 2015, which killed 14 people, focused attention on immigrants鈥� social-media use, after officials acknowledged that they had missed signs of online radicalization in an online-messaging platform used by the husband and wife who carried out the attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year, John F. Kelly, who was then the secretary of homeland security and is now Mr. Trump鈥檚 chief of staff, told members of Congress that his department was considering asking visitors for passwords and access to online accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淲e want to get on their social media, with passwords,鈥� Mr. Kelly told members of the House Homeland Security Committee. 鈥淚f they don鈥檛 want to cooperate, then you don鈥檛 come in.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, the government has stopped short of demanding passwords, though travelers have reported being asked for them, on a sporadic basis, at airports and other ports of entry. By some measures, the number of international visitors to the United States has begun to slip, although foreign tourism to New York City set a record last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new State Department requirements will not take effect immediately. The proposal set off a 60-day period for public comment, which ends on May 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sina Weibo, one of China鈥檚 largest social media platforms, several users were critical of the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淒oes it mean someone鈥檚 visa application will likely be rejected if he/she has been critical of the U.S.?鈥� one wrote. 鈥淲hat about your sacred 鈥榝reedom of speech?鈥欌��\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother user wrote: 鈥淲e Chinese have learned well enough the lessons to be drawn from isolation. Now it鈥檚 America鈥檚 turn.鈥�\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�1鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圔y SEWELL CHAN锛�\r\n鏍规嵁缇庡浗鍥藉姟闄笂鍛ㄤ簲鍏竷鐨勬柊鎻愬嚭鐨勮瀹氾紝鍑犱箮鎵�鏈夌敵璇风編鍥藉叆澧冪璇佺殑浜洪兘灏嗚瑕佹眰鎻愪氦浠栦滑鍦ㄨ繃鍘讳簲骞撮噷浣跨敤鐨勭ぞ浜ゅ獟浣撶敤鎴峰悕銆傛瘡骞寸敵璇峰叆缇庣璇佺殑浜烘暟鎹及璁℃湁1470涓囦汉銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍘诲勾9鏈堬紝鐗规湕鏅斂搴滄浘瀹ｅ竷锛岀敵璇风Щ姘戠璇佺殑浜哄皢琚姹傛彁渚涚ぞ浜ゅ獟浣撴暟鎹紝鍙楄繖涓鍒掑奖鍝嶇殑浜虹害涓�71涓囥�傛柊鎻愯灏嗘瀬澶у湴鎵╁ぇ杩欐潯鍛戒护鐨勮鐩栬寖鍥达紝鎶婃瘡骞寸害1400涓囩敵璇烽潪绉绘皯绛捐瘉鐨勪汉鍖呮嫭杩涙潵銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n璇ユ彁璁秹鍙�20涓ぞ浜ゅ獟浣撳钩鍙般�傚畠浠綋涓殑澶ч儴鍒嗘槸缇庡浗鐨勶細Facebook銆丗lickr銆丟oogle+銆両nstagram銆侀鑻�(LinkedIn)銆丮yspace銆丳interest銆丷eddit銆乀umblr銆乀witter銆乂ine浠ュ強YouTube銆備絾涔熸湁涓�浜涙槸缇庡浗浠ュ鐨勶細涓浗鐨勭綉绔欒眴鐡ｃ�丵Q銆佹柊娴井鍗氥�佽吘璁井鍗氬拰浼橀叿锛涗縿缃楁柉鐨勭ぞ浜ょ綉缁淰K锛涘垱寤轰簬姣斿埄鏃剁殑Twoo锛涗互鍙婃媺鑴辩淮浜氱殑涓�涓棶绛斿钩鍙癆sk.fm銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鐗规湕鏅�荤粺鍦ㄧ珵閫夋湡闂存浘鎵胯锛岃瀵归偅浜涙兂杩涘叆缇庡浗鐨勪汉杩涜鈥滄瀬绔鏌モ�濄�傚幓骞�3鏈堬紝缇庡浗鍥藉姟闄㈡寚绀轰笘鐣屽悇鍦扮殑棰嗕簨瀹樺憳鍔犲己瀵圭璇佺敵璇疯�呯殑瀹℃煡銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗚繖椤规柊鎻愯锛屽皢缁欐暟鐧句竾鍖呮嫭宸磋タ銆佷腑鍥姐�佸嵃搴﹀拰澧ㄨタ鍝ョ瓑鍥藉叕姘戝湪鍐呯殑鐢宠鏉ョ編鍥借繘琛屽晢鍔℃垨濞变箰鏃呰鐨勪汉澧炲姞涓�涓柊鐨勫疄闄呰姹傘��\r\n\r\n\r\n缇庡浗閫氬父缁欎簣绾�40涓浗瀹剁殑鍏皯鍏嶇璇佹梾琛岀殑寰呴亣锛岃繖浜涘浗瀹跺寘鎷境澶у埄浜氥�佽嫳鍥姐�佸姞鎷垮ぇ銆佹硶鍥姐�佸痉鍥姐�佹棩鏈拰闊╁浗绛変富瑕佺洘鍥斤紝杩欎簺鍥藉鐨勪汉灏嗕笉鍙楁柊瑕佹眰鐨勫奖鍝嶃��\r\n\r\n\r\n姝ゅ锛屼娇鐢ㄥ浜ゅ拰鍥犲叕绛捐瘉鏃呰鐨勮闂�呬篃澶ч兘涓嶅彈鏂拌瀹氱殑褰卞搷銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鏂拌瀹氱殑娑堟伅浜庡懆浜斾紶鍑哄悗锛屾壒璇勪箣澹伴殢涔嬭�屾潵銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鐗规湕鏅斂搴滀簬鍛ㄤ簲绉帮紝灏嗚鍒掕鍑犱箮鎵�鏈夌敵璇风編鍥藉叆澧冪璇佺殑浜烘彁浜よ繃鍘讳簲骞存潵鐨勭ぞ浜ゅ獟浣撹处鍙风敤鎴峰悕銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滆繖涓皾璇曞皢鏀堕泦鏁扮櫨涓囩璇佺敵璇疯�呯殑绀句氦濯掍綋娲诲姩鐨勫ぇ閲忎俊鎭紝杩欐槸鐗规湕鏅斂搴滅殑鍙堜竴涓棤鏁堜笖鏈変弗閲嶉棶棰樼殑璁″垝锛屸�濈編鍥藉叕姘戣嚜鐢辫仈鐩�(American Civil Liberties Union)鍥藉瀹夊叏椤圭洰璐熻矗浜烘捣绾陈峰杽濮嗘柉(Hina Shamsi)璇淬�傗�滆繖浼氳瑷�璁哄拰缁撶ぞ鑷敱鍙楀埌濞佽儊锛屼粠鑰屼镜鐘Щ姘戝拰缇庡浗鍏皯鐨勬潈鍒╋紝灏ゅ叾璁╀汉浠笉鐢卞緱寮�濮嬫媴蹇冿紝浠栦滑鍦ㄧ綉涓婅鐨勮瘽鏄惁浼氳鏀垮簻瀹樺憳璇В鎴栬璇汇�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n寰烽浄濉炲皵澶у(Drexel University)娉曞鍓暀鎺堥樋灏煎皵路鍗″皵姹�(Anil Kalhan)浠庝簨绉绘皯鍜屽浗闄呬汉鏉冩柟闈㈢殑宸ヤ綔锛屼粬鍦═witter涓婂啓閬擄紝鈥滆繖鏄繃鍒嗙殑渚垫壈锛屾槸鍐嶈崚鍞愪笉杩囩殑鍋氭硶銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook璇达紝鍏徃鐨勭珛鍦鸿嚜鍘诲勾浠ユ潵娌℃湁鍙樿繃锛屽叕鍙告浘鍦ㄥ幓骞磋〃绀猴細鈥滄垜浠弽瀵逛换浣曡揩浣挎梾琛岃�呭湪杈瑰涓婁氦鍑轰釜浜鸿处鍙蜂俊鎭紙鍖呮嫭瀵嗙爜锛夌殑鍔姏銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n闄ょぞ浜ゅ獟浣撲俊鎭锛岀璇佺敵璇蜂汉杩樿瑕佹眰鎻愪緵浠ュ墠鐨勬姢鐓у彿鐮併�佺數璇濆彿鐮佸拰鐢靛瓙閭欢鍦板潃锛屼粬浠殑鍥介檯鏃呰璁板綍锛屼粬浠互鍓嶆槸鍚︽浘琚┍閫愬嚭澧冦�佹垨杩濆弽杩囩Щ姘戞硶锛屼互鍙婁粬浠殑浜插睘鏄惁鍙備笌杩囨亹鎬栦富涔夋椿鍔ㄣ��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滃绛捐瘉鐢宠浜轰繚鎸佷弗鏍肩殑绛涙煡鏍囧噯鏄竴涓姩鎬佺殑杩囩▼锛屽繀椤讳笌鏂板▉鑳佺殑鍑虹幇鐩搁�傚簲锛屸�濈編鍥藉浗鍔￠櫌鍦ㄤ竴浠藉０鏄庝腑璇淬�傗�滄垜浠凡缁忚姹傛墍鏈夌璇佺敵璇疯�呮彁渚涙湁闄愮殑鑱旂郴淇℃伅銆佹梾琛屽巻鍙层�佸搴垚鍛樹俊鎭拰浠ュ墠鐨勫湴鍧�銆備粠绛捐瘉鐢宠鑰呴偅閲屾敹闆嗚繖浜涢澶栫殑淇℃伅锛屽皢鍔犲己鎴戜滑瀹℃煡杩欎簺鐢宠浜恒�佺‘璁や粬浠韩浠界殑杩囩▼銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n姣忓勾鏈夋暟鐧句竾浜哄湪缃戜笂濉啓鍚嶄负DS-160鐨勯潪绉绘皯绛捐瘉鐢宠琛ㄣ�傛嵁缇庡浗鍥藉姟闄㈢殑璇存硶锛屽～鍐欒繖涓〃鏍煎ぇ绾﹂渶瑕佽姳90鍒嗛挓鐨勬椂闂淬��\r\n\r\n\r\n2015骞达紝鍔犲窞鍦ｈ礉绾宠开璇哄彂鐢熺殑鎭愭�栬鍑讳簨浠跺鑷�14浜烘浜★紝瀹樺憳浠簨鍚庢壙璁わ紝浠栦滑娌℃湁娉ㄦ剰鍒板埗閫犺鍑荤殑澶鍦ㄤ粬浠娇鐢ㄧ殑鍦ㄧ嚎鐭俊骞冲彴涓婅〃鐜板嚭鏉ョ殑婵�杩涜抗璞°�傝嚜閭ｄ箣鍚庯紝浜轰滑寮�濮嬪叧娉ㄧЩ姘戝绀句氦濯掍綋鐨勪娇鐢ㄣ��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍘诲勾锛屾椂浠诲浗鍦熷畨鍏ㄩ儴閮ㄩ暱銆佺幇涓虹壒鏈楁櫘骞曞儦闀跨殑绾︾堪路F路鍑埄(John F.
