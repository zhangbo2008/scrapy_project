Those who would not or could not leave have faced severe food shortages and scant medical care.\r\nDeals to evacuate other parts of the suburb sent thousands of civilians and rebel fighters to the rebel-held province of Idlib.\r\nState-run Syrian media says busloads of rebels and their families began leaving the Syrian town of Douma Sunday, northeast of Damascus, apparently on their way to Idlib.\r\nA Syrian operation to take back Douma has also left the town in ruins.\r\nDouma was one of the Syrian cities that gave birth to the anti-Assad protests in 2011. The protests grew into the current civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, devastated Syrian cities, and helped stoke Cold War-style tension between the United States and pro-Syria Russia.\r\nPope Francis used part of his Easter message Sunday to again call for the end of what he calls the \"carnage\" in Syria.\r\n\r\n琚彊鍒╀簹鏀垮簻鍐涘洟鍥㈠寘鍥寸殑涓滃彜濉�\r\n\r\n淇勭綏鏂啗鏂硅锛屽凡杈炬垚涓�涓垵姝ュ崗璁紝鍏佽鍙欏埄浜氬弽鏀垮簻姝﹁浠庡叾鎺у埗鐨勬渶鍚庡湴鍖轰笢鍙ゅ鎾ょ銆�\r\n鍙欏埄浜氭斂搴�6鏄熸湡鍓嶅彂鍔ㄥ啗浜嬫敾鍔夸互鏉ワ紝杩欏皢鏄彊鍒╀簹鏀垮簻绗竴娆￠噸鏂板叏闈㈡帶鍒跺ぇ椹＋闈╅儕鍖恒��6鏄熸湡鐨勫啿绐侀�犳垚澶氬ぇ1600骞虫皯涓х敓銆�\r\n鍙欏埄浜氬弽鏀垮簻姝﹁杩樻病鏈夎瘉瀹炰縿缃楁柉鏂归潰鐨勬秷鎭�備縿缃楁柉涔熸病鏈夎鎾ょ浠�涔堟椂闂村紑濮嬨��\r\n鍙欏埄浜氭斂搴滃啗瀵瑰彜濉斿湴鍖虹殑鍦伴潰鍜岀┖涓敾鍑昏揩浣挎垚鍗冧笂涓囦汉绂诲紑瀹跺洯銆備笉鎰挎剰鍜屾棤娉曟挙绂荤殑灞呮皯闈复涓ラ噸鐨勯鍝佸拰鍖昏嵂鐭己銆�\r\n鍙欏埄浜氬畼鏂瑰獟浣撹锛屽弽鏀垮簻鍔涢噺鐨勪汉鍛樺強鍏跺浜烘槦鏈熷ぉ寮�濮嬩箻鍧愬杈嗗ぇ宸寸寮�閮介┈锛岀湅鏉ヤ粬浠殑鐩殑鍦版槸浼婂痉鍒╁崪銆�\r\n鍙欏埄浜氭斂搴滃ず鍥為兘椹殑鍐涗簨琛屽姩姣佸潖浜嗚繖搴у煄闀囩殑澶у寤虹瓚銆�\r\n閮介┈鏄�2011骞存渶鏃╁彂鐢熷弽闃胯惃寰锋姉璁殑鍦板尯涔嬩竴銆傚彊鍒╀簹鍚勫湴鐨勬姉璁紨鍙樹负鎸佺画鑷充粖鐨勫唴鎴橈紝鏁板崄涓囧钩姘戝湪鍐茬獊涓抚鐢燂紝寰堝鍩庡競澶蜂负搴熷锛屽苟瀵艰嚧缇庡浗鍜屾敮鎸侀樋钀ㄥ痉鏀垮簻鐨勪縿缃楁柉涔嬮棿瀵艰嚧绫讳技鍐锋垬鏃舵湡鐨勭揣寮犲叧绯汇��\r\n缃楅┈澶╀富鏁欏畻鏂规祹鍚勬槦鏈熷ぉ鍦ㄤ粬鐨勫娲昏妭鏂囧憡涓啀娆″懠鍚佸仠姝㈠湪鍙欏埄浜氱殑澶ц妯℃潃鎴��"
