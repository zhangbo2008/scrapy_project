"My mom went to the same hairdresser for 16 years.\r\n\n16年来我妈一直找同一个理发师理发。\r\n\nShe calls me up.\r\n\n她打电话给我。\r\n\n\r\nShe’s just so angry.\r\n\n她太生气了。\r\n\nAnd I’m like, “What’s wrong?”\r\n\n我说，怎么了？\r\n\n“I had to change hairdressers.”\r\n\n她说，我只能换一个理发师了。\r\n\n“Did Rocky close his shop down?”\r\n\n洛基的店关门了？\r\n\nShe’s like, “No. He’s gay.”\r\n\n她说，“不，他是同性恋。”\r\n\nAnd I’m like, “You didn’t know? Doesn’t he have a son with his supposed best friend who’s male?”\r\n\n我说，你不知道吗？他不是和他据称的好朋友有一个儿子吗？\r\n\nIf we were going to screen people, my parents would not have been people that should have had children.\r\n\n如果我们要对人做筛选，我的父母不会是那种可以养育后代的人。\r\n\nOne week after I was in China, Lehman Brothers collapsed. I didn’t come back. I had a job that I loved, and then I met Richard.\r\n\n我到中国一周后，雷曼兄弟倒闭了。我没有回来。我有一份我喜欢的工作，然后我遇到了理查德。\r\n\nFor the next 60 days, we went out every single day. And I would meet his friends, but I wasn’t meeting his family.\r\n\n在接下来的60天里，我们每天都在一起。我见了他的朋友，但没有见他的家人。\r\n\nThis went on for almost a year, and then he came up to me and says, “My mom would like you to join us for Chinese New Year Dinner.”\r\n\n这持续了将近一年。然后他来跟我说，“我妈想你来我们家吃年夜饭。”\r\n\nThere was never a discussion about us.\r\n\n他们从来不谈论我们。\r\n\nHis parents would invite me to weddings in the family, his dad’s birthday, yet no discussion.\r\n\n他的父母会邀请我参加家族婚礼、他爸爸的生日，但是，不谈论。 \r\n\nRichard would put on his wedding ring, but he would take it off anytime he saw his family.\r\n\n理查德会戴上他的结婚戒指，但见到家人时他就会把它取下来。\r\n\nI knew that it was going to be hard for them to understand, but I’m like, “You have to tell them.”\r\n\n我知道他们很难理解，但我说，你必须告诉他们。\r\n\nHe’s all upset. I’m like, “What’s wrong?”\r\n\n他很沮丧，我说，怎么了。\r\n\nHe’s like, “They don’t accept us.”\r\n\n他说，他们不接受我们。\r\n\nAnd that was devastating.\r\n\n太让人难过了。 \r\n\nThey may say we can’t do this.\r\n\n“他们可能会说我们不能这样。\r\n\nBut, you know, over time, they’re going to see that’s not true.\r\n\n……但是，你知道，随着时间的推移他们会发现不是那样。” \r\n\nIan is from Richard and Eli is from me.\r\n\n伊恩来自理查德，而伊莱来自我。\r\n\nWe heard the two heartbeats, and we were both crying. Sometimes, it’s just surreal.\r\n\n我们听到了两个心跳声，我们都哭了。有时候感觉不像是真的。\r\n\nWhen the boys were born, Richard’s parents would only want to see pictures of Ian or FaceTime to see Ian, and even made suggestions of Richard taking Ian and going back to China.\r\n\n男孩们出生时，理查德的父母只想看到伊恩的照片，或通过FaceTime看到伊恩，甚至还提议让理查德带伊恩回中国。\r\n\nOr, Richard divorces me and marries an American woman.\r\n\n或者要理查德和我离婚并娶一个美国女人。\r\n\nWhat occurred to me was, by the time we got to the, “send them to school in China” craziness, we had actually made progress.\r\n\n我发现，等到发展到“要不把孩子们送到中国读书”这种疯狂境地时，我们实际上是在改善的。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nWe weren’t separating them anymore.\r\n\n我们已经不再把他们分隔开了。\r\n\nWe weren’t divorcing anymore.\r\n\n我们不用离婚了。\r\n\nIt was, little by little, moving to acceptance.\r\n\n是一点点在被接受。 \r\n\nRichard is their only child. His parents love him very much, and he loves his parents very much. So I know that it isn’t from a place of hate. It’s from a place of just not understanding and needing time to adjust.\r\n\n理查德是他们唯一的孩子。他的父母非常爱他，他非常爱他的父母。所以，我知道这一切并不源于恨。这一切源于不理解和需要时间去调整。\r\n\nBut it is really, really hard because it’s your kids. And you’re just like, “How could you treat anybody like that?”\r\n\n但这真的很难，因为这是你的孩子，你会觉得，你怎么能像这样对待任何人呢？ \r\n\nA family is not just a structure.
