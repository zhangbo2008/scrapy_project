"Why Fidgeting Is Good Medicine\r\nAre you a fidgeter?\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom now on, you can ignore the frequent requests you undoubtedly receive to just sit still. A new study finds that fidgeting 鈥� the toe-tapping, foot-wagging and other body movements that annoy your co-workers 鈥� is in fact good for your health.\r\n\r\n\r\nSitting is one of the scourges of modern life. We sit during meetings, automobile and airplane trips, while completing lengthy work assignments and while binge-watching 鈥淪tranger Things.鈥� Studies of movement patterns indicate that most of us spend between eight and 10 hours each day seated. During that time, our bodies and, in particular, our legs barely move.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe health consequences of this muscular immobility are well documented and include an increased risk for weight gain, as well as diabetes, since unused muscles in the legs do not pull sugar from the blood, leading to a dangerous rise in blood sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the most immediate impact of oversitting is on our vasculature. Studies show that uninterrupted sitting causes an abrupt and significant decline in blood flow to the legs. This is problematic since, when blood flow drops, friction along the vessel walls also declines. The cells that line these walls, which can sense changes in the friction, begin to pump out proteins that contribute over time to hardening and narrowing of the arteries. This may make biological sense, because arteries don鈥檛 need to be as flexible when there isn鈥檛 much blood in them, but when the blood flow increases, the blood vessel remains stiff, increasing blood pressure and raising the risk for atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can combat that situation easily by standing up and moving, causing leg muscles to contract and blood flow to remain steady.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淏ut there are many situations in which people cannot just stand up,鈥� such as during long meetings or car trips, said Jaume Padilla, an assistant professor of nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Missouri in Columbia, who led the new study.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Dr. Padilla and his colleagues began to consider other, relatively unobtrusive and practical ways that someone might combat the decline in blood flow associated with sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the new study, which was published in July in The American Journal of Physiology Heart and Circulatory Physiology, they hit upon fidgeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Padilla and his colleagues thought it was conceivable that lower-body fidgeting might also result in enough muscular activity to elevate blood flow to the legs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo test that possibility, they recruited 11 healthy college students and, using ultrasound and a blood pressure cuff, first measured the level of normal blood flow through one of the main arteries in their legs and determined how well that artery responded to changes in blood pressure 鈥� a marker of arterial health.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen they asked each subject to sit for three hours in front of a desk. The volunteers could study, work on their computers, talk on the phone or otherwise amuse themselves but, for those three hours, were not allowed to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost importantly, they asked the volunteers to keep one leg perfectly still, the foot flat against the floor and unmoving. With the other leg, the volunteers were told to fidget 鈥� tapping their heels against the ground for one minute and then staying still for four minutes. (A clock chimed to let them know when to start or stop fidgeting.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the course of the three hours, the researchers monitored the blood flow in the volunteers鈥� leg arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blood flow in the unmoving leg declined precipitously, but it rose in the fidgeting leg, compared both to baseline levels and to the unmoving leg.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore striking, at the end of the three hours, when the researchers again tested the ability of the volunteers鈥� arteries to respond to changes in blood pressure, the vessel in the unmoving leg no longer worked as well as it had during baseline testing, which suggests it was already not as healthy as it had been.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the artery in the volunteers鈥� fidgeting leg responded as well as or better than it had at baseline to changes in blood pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淭o be honest, we were surprised by the magnitude of the difference鈥� between the two legs, Dr. Padilla said.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淲e had expected that fidgeting might attenuate鈥� the reduction in blood flow and any subsequent acute changes in vessel health, he said, but the differences in terms of blood flow and subsequent arterial function were much more significant than they had anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淭he muscular contractions associated with fidgeting are really quite small,鈥� he said, 鈥渂ut it appears that they are sufficient鈥� to combat some of the unhealthy consequences of sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, the study was small, short term and involved only healthy young people. It also did not retest the volunteers鈥� vascular function after they had risen and begun to move around normally. Dr. Padilla said he thought it was likely that any undesirable consequences from this single session of not moving would soon disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut repeated bouts of muscular stillness could over time cause such impacts to become permanent, he said.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo if you can鈥檛 rise and walk around during your next lengthy meeting, he said, tap your toes. Bob your feet. Keep your legs in motion somehow, no matter how slight. And if your spouse or aisle mate should frown in annoyance, point out that science now says that fidgeting is good medicine.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�3鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圙RETCHEN REYNOLDS锛�\r\n\r\n浣犱竴瀹氱粡甯歌瑕佹眰鈥滆�佽�佸疄瀹炲潗濂解�濄�備絾浠庣幇鍦ㄥ紑濮嬶紝涓嶅繀鍐嶇悊浼氶偅浜涜姹備簡銆傛渶鏂扮殑鐮旂┒琛ㄦ槑锛屼竴浜涘彲鑳戒細鎵撴壈韬竟鍚屼簨鐨勫皬鍔ㄤ綔锛屾瘮濡傜敤鑴氭墦鎷嶅瓙銆佹檭鑴氱瓑绛夛紝鍏跺疄瀵硅韩浣撳仴搴锋槸鏈夌泭鐨勩��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍧愮潃涓嶅姩鏄幇浠ｇ敓娲讳腑鐨勪竴浠惰嫤宸簨銆傛垜浠潗鐫�寮�浼氾紝鍧愭苯杞︽垨鏈烘梾琛岋紝鏃堕棿鍧愮潃宸ヤ綔鎴栬�呬竴鍙ｆ皵鐪嬪畬銆婃�鐗╄銆嬨�傚韬綋杩愬姩瑙勫緥鐨勭爺绌舵樉绀猴紝澶у鏁颁汉姣忓ぉ鍧愮潃鐨勬椂闂磋揪鍏埌10涓皬鏃躲�傚湪杩欐湡闂达紝鎴戜滑鐨勫叏韬瀬灏戞椿鍔紝灏ゅ叾鏄吙閮ㄣ��\r\n\r\n\r\n鑲岃倝鏃堕棿闈欐涓嶅姩瀵瑰仴搴风殑璐熼潰褰卞搷鏈夋嵁鍙煡锛氶櫎浜嗗彲鑳藉鑷翠綋閲嶅鍔犱箣澶栵紝鐢变簬鏈椿鍔ㄧ殑鑵块儴鑲岃倝涓嶄細浠庤娑蹭腑鍚告敹绯栧垎锛屽鑷磋绯栨按骞冲嵄闄╁崌楂橈紝鎮ｇ硸灏跨梾鐨勯櫓涔熶細闅忎箣澧炲姞銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n涓嶈繃涔呭潗鏈�鐩存帴鍗卞鍒扮殑锛屾槸浜轰綋琛�绠＄郴缁熺殑鍋ュ悍銆傜爺绌惰〃鏄庯紝涓嶉棿鏂箙鍧愪細閫犳垚鑵块儴琛�娴侀噺鏄捐憲楠ら檷銆傝繖浼氭湁闂锛屽洜涓洪殢鐫�琛�娴侀噺鐨勪笅闄嶏紝琛�娑插琛�绠″鐨勬懇鎿︿細鐩稿簲鍑忓皯銆傝绠″缁嗚優浼氭劅搴斿埌绠″鎽╂摝鐨勬敼鍙橈紝浜庢槸寮�濮嬫车鍑鸿泲鐧借川锛屾棩绉湀绱紝浼氭垚涓轰績浣胯绠＄‖鍖栧彉绐勭殑鍥犵礌涔嬩竴銆備粠鐢熺墿瀛﹁搴︽潵璇达紝杩欏彲鑳芥槸鏈夐亾鐞嗙殑锛屾瘯绔熷姩鑴夊湪娌℃湁澶ч噺琛�娑叉祦閫氱殑鎯呭喌涓嬶紝涓嶉渶瑕佸緢鏈夊脊鎬с�備絾褰撹娴侀噺澧炲ぇ鏃讹紝濡傛灉琛�绠′緷鐒跺緢鍍电‖锛屽氨浼氶�犳垚琛�鍘嬪崌楂橈紝澧炲姞鍔ㄨ剦绮ユ牱纭寲鐨勯櫓銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鎴戜滑鍙渶瑕佺珯璧锋潵璧板姩璧板姩锛岃鑵块儴鑲岃倝寰椾互鏀剁缉锛岃琛�娑茬殑娴佸姩淇濇寔绋冲畾锛屽氨鍙互杞绘澗搴斿涓婅堪杩欎簺闂銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滀絾鏄湪寰堝鎯呭喌涓嬶紝浜轰滑骞朵笉鑳芥兂绔欏氨绔欙紝鈥濆瘑鑻忛噷鍝ヤ鸡姣斾簹澶у钀ュ吇涓庤繍鍔ㄧ敓鐞嗗鍔╃悊鏁欐巿璞路甯曡开鍒╀簹(Jaume Padilla)璇达紝姣斿鏃堕棿鐨勪細璁�佸潗杞︾瓑绛夈�傚笗杩埄浜氭槸杩欓」鏈�鏂扮爺绌剁殑鍥㈤槦甯﹀ご浜恒��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍥犳锛屽笗杩埄浜氬拰鍚屼簨浠紑濮嬫�濊�冨浣曢�氳繃涓�浜涙洿瀹為檯涔熺浉瀵逛笉閫犳垚骞叉壈鐨勬柟寮忥紝鏉ュ府鍔╀汉浠В鍐充箙鍧愬甫鏉ョ殑鑵块儴琛�娴佸噺灏戠殑闂銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浠栦滑浜庝粖骞�7鏈堝湪銆婄編鍥藉績鑴忓拰寰幆鐢熺悊瀛︽潅蹇椼�嬩笂鍙戣〃浜嗚椤圭爺绌舵垚鏋溿�傜爺绌朵腑锛屼粬浠彂鐜颁簡鈥滄姈鑵库�濅箣绫荤殑灏忓姩浣滅殑鍔熸晥銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n甯曡开鍒╀簹鍜屼粬鐨勫洟闃熻涓猴紝涓嬪崐韬交寰殑鎶栧姩涔熷彲浠ュ甫鏉ヨ冻澶熺殑鑲岃倝杩愬姩锛屾彁楂樿吙閮ㄧ殑琛�娑叉祦閲忥紝杩欐槸鏈夊彲鑳界殑銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣犳槸涓竴鍧愪笅灏辩埍鎶栬吙鐨勪汉涔�?\r\n\r\n\r\n涓轰簡璇佹槑杩欑鍙兘鎬э紝浠栦滑鎷涘嫙浜�11鍚嶈韩浣撳仴搴风殑澶у鐢熷織鎰胯�咃紝鍒╃敤瓒呭０娉㈠拰琛�鍘嬫娴嬭甯﹂鍏堟祴閲忓嚭姝ｅ父鎯呭喌涓嬫瘡浜鸿吙閮ㄤ富瑕佸姩鑴夌殑琛�娴侀噺锛屽苟娴嬪畾鍔ㄨ剦瀵硅鍘嬫敼鍙樼殑鍙嶅簲鑳藉姏鈥斺�旇繖鏄　閲忓姩鑴夊仴搴风殑鎸囨爣涔嬩竴銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n闅忓悗锛屼粬浠畨鎺掑疄楠屽璞″湪妗屽瓙鍓嶉潤鍧愪笁涓皬鏃讹紝杩欐湡闂村彲浠ュ涔狅紝鐢ㄧ數鑴戝伐浣滐紝鎵撶數璇濇垨鑰呯敤鍏朵粬鏂瑰紡濞变箰娑堥仯锛屼絾鏄笉鑳界珯璧锋潵銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鏈�閲嶈鐨勬槸锛屼粬浠姹傚織鎰胯�呬繚鎸佷竴鏉¤吙缁濆闈欐锛岃剼鎺屽钩璐村湴闈紝涓嶈兘鏈変换浣曠Щ鍔ㄣ�傝�屽彟涓�鏉¤吙鍒欓渶瑕佷笉鏃舵姈鍔ㄢ�斺�斿厛鎶捣鑴氳窡鎷嶆墦鍦伴潰涓�鍒嗛挓锛岀劧鍚庝繚鎸佽创鍦伴潤姝㈠洓鍒嗛挓銆傦紙璁℃椂鍣ㄤ細鍙戝嚭澹板搷锛屾彁閱掍粬浠綍鏃跺紑濮嬪拰鍋滄鎶栧姩銆傦級\r\n\r\n\r\n鍦ㄤ笁涓皬鏃剁殑娴嬭瘯杩囩▼涓紝鐮旂┒浜哄憳鐩戞祴鐫�蹇楁効鑰呬滑鑵块儴鍔ㄨ剦鐨勮娴侀噺銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n娴嬭瘯缁撴灉鏄剧ず锛岄潤姝笉鍔ㄧ殑鑵跨殑琛�娴侀噺鏄捐憲闄嶄綆锛涜�屼笉鏃舵姈鍔ㄧ殑閭ｆ潯鑵匡紝涓庢祴璇曞墠鐨勫熀鍑嗙姸鎬佸拰闈欐鐨勯偅鏉¤吙鐩告瘮锛岃娴侀噺閮芥湁鎵�澧炪��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏇磋浜烘儕璁剁殑鏄紝娴嬭瘯缁撴潫鍚庯紝鐮旂┒浜哄憳鍐嶆妫�娴嬪織鎰胯�呰吙閮ㄥ姩鑴夊琛�鍘嬪彉鍖栫殑鍙嶅簲鑳藉姏锛屼粬浠彂鐜帮紝闈欐鑵跨殑鍔ㄨ剦鍙嶅簲鑳藉姏宸茬粡涓嶅鍩哄噯鐘舵�佹祴璇曠殑鏃跺�欎簡銆傝繖璇存槑锛岃繖鏉¤吙鐨勮绠″凡缁忎笉濡備竴寮�濮嬮偅涔堝仴搴蜂簡銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗘槸锛屽織鎰胯�呬笉鏃舵姈鍔ㄧ殑閭ｆ潯鑵夸笌鍩哄噯鐘舵�佺浉姣旓紝瀵硅鍘嬪彉鍖栫殑鍙嶅簲鑳藉姏涓嶅彉锛屾湁浜虹敋鑷虫洿濂姐��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滃潶鐧借锛屽弻鑵挎祴璇曠粨鏋滅殑宸ㄥぇ宸紓璁╂垜浠篃寰堟儕璁讹紝鈥濆笗杩埄浜氳銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滄垜浠璁★紝鎶栬吙鍙兘浼氱紦瑙ｂ�濊娴侀噺鐨勯檷浣庝互鍙婇殢涔嬭�屾潵鐨勮绠″仴搴锋柟闈弗閲嶈“閫�锛屼粬璇淬�備絾鏄紝鍦ㄨ娴侀噺鍜岀敱姝ゅ紩鍙戠殑琛�绠″姛鑳芥柟闈㈢殑鏄捐憲宸紓杩滄瘮浠栦滑棰勬兂鐨勮澶у緱澶氥��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滄姈鑵挎墍甯︽潵鐨勮倢鑲夋敹缂╁叾瀹炲緢寰皬锛屸�濆笗杩埄浜氳锛屸�滀絾鐜板湪鐪嬫潵锛岃繖宸茬粡瓒冲鈥濆鎶椾箙鍧愬甫鏉ョ殑涓�浜涘仴搴烽棶棰樹簡銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n褰撶劧锛岃繖椤圭爺绌舵牱鏈緝灏忥紝鏃堕棿杈冪煭锛岄�夊彇鐨勭爺绌跺璞′篃浠呴檺浜庡仴搴风殑骞磋交浜恒�傚悓鏃讹紝鐮旂┒浜哄憳涔熸病鏈夊湪蹇楁効鑰呰捣韬甯告椿鍔ㄥ悗锛屽啀娆℃祴璇曚粬浠殑琛�绠″姛鑳姐�傚笗杩埄浜氳涓猴紝鍗曟闈欏潗娴嬭瘯鎵�甯︽潵鐨勪笉鑹弽搴斿彲鑳藉緢蹇兘浼氭秷澶便��\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗕粬涔熻锛岃倢鑲夌粡甯稿浜庨潤姝㈢姸鎬侊紝鏃ョН鏈堢疮锛屽彲鑳戒細璁╀笂杩板奖鍝嶅彉鎴愭案涔呮�х殑銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍥犳锛屽鏋滀綘涓嬫鍦ㄦ极闀跨殑浼氳鏈熼棿娌℃硶绔欒捣鏉ヨ蛋鍔紝甯曡开鍒╀簹寤鸿浣犵敤鑴氬皷鎷嶆媿鍦伴潰鎴栨槸棰犱竴棰犺剼锛屼繚鎸佽吙閮ㄨ倢鑲夊浜庢煇绉嶈繍鍔ㄧ姸鎬侊紝鍝�曟槸鏈�杞诲井鐨勮繍鍔ㄣ�傚鏋滀綘鐨勪即渚ｆ垨鑰呰繃閬撻偅杈圭殑浜鸿浣犳墦鎵帮紝鐨辫捣浜嗙湁澶达紝浣犲彲浠ュ憡璇変粬浠細绉戝宸茬粡璇佹槑锛屾姈鑵挎湁鐩婂仴搴枫��\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氬紶绗戝ぉ"
