The employee only gave his surname, Li, and referred to a statement posted on the company's website earlier this month that said the translation of \"The Big Bang Theory\" was under way and would be shown soon on CCTV.\n　　据北京CBM影视译制机构的一位员工透露，该公司正在译制该剧，完成后将交给央视中文字幕版的《生活大爆炸》。这名李姓员工称，本月该公司网站上已经有声明称《生活大爆炸》的译制正在进行中，并且很快就会在央视播出。\n　　Sohu's Zhang said he didn't know about the translation for CCTV, and said Sohu had exclusive online rights to the show in mainland China.\n　　张朝阳称他不知道央视译制版的事情，并且坚称搜狐是大陆拥有在线播放该剧版权的网站。\n　　Beijing has in the past allowed video websites to operate with few of the restrictions that movie and TV broadcasters face, possibly to avoid stifling what was seen as a promising high-tech industry.\n　　之前视频网站相较各电视台面临的限制少，可能是为了避免这一颇有前景的高科技产业的发展。\n　　Video websites, with looser controls, show dramas and comedies from the United States, South Korea and Europe and their own programs. They were not required to submit programs for approval, which allowed them to get imported material on the air faster than TV stations.\n　　视频网站以前管制较松，可以播出来自美国、韩国和欧洲的剧情片和喜剧类，也可以自制剧。由于视频网站不需要提交节目审批，所以引进正在播出的剧集比电视台要快。"
