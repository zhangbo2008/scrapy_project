"Our phones, it seems, are an extension of ourselves. More than half of American smartphone owners check their device a few times an hour, according to a 2015 Gallup poll, and 81 percent say they keep their phones nearby during waking hours almost all of the time. For some, a smartphone might as well be an extra limb.\n　　现在好像手机是我们自己的延伸。2015年盖洛普民意测验调查显示，美国拥有手机的人当中，超过一半的人一个小时内要看好几次手机，而且81%的受访者称他们只要醒着几乎会一直把手机放在身边。对于一些人来说，智能手机就好比身体的一部分。\n　　That's what artist Antoine Geiger depicts in his photo series \"Sur-Fake,\" highlighting our attachment to the the ubiquitous devices by depicting people's faces stretched and connected to the smartphones they hold in their hands.\n　　这就是艺术家安东尼・盖革在其“摄魂怪”照片集中刻画的内容，通过对人们的脸向外延伸与手中拿着的智能手机连在一起的这一刻画，突出我们对这无所不在设备的依恋。\n　　The images remove human faces and replace our most distinct and recognizable features with a piece of plastic and glass. With this effect, Geiger shows that our smartphones -- or what lives inside them -- have become more of our identity than our physical selves. The photos are startling: If we're constantly attached to a screen, are we under its control?\n　　这些照片将人们的脸进行空间移动，用一块塑料和玻璃代替我们最直观最易识别的面部特征。盖革用这种效果向人们展示我们的手机――或者寄生在手机里的东西――已经成为了我们的身份特征而不仅仅是我们的外在物体。这些照片令人震惊：如果我们频繁地盯着手机看，它已经控制我们了吗?"
