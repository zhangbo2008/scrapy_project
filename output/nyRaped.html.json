INEZ AND VINOODH\n\r\n\r\nOn Friday, President Trump tweeted that if what Dr. Blasey said was true, she would have filed a police report years ago. But I understand why both women would keep this information to themselves for so many years, without involving the police. For years, I did the same thing. On Friday, I tweeted about what had happened to me so many years ago.\r\n\n上周五，特朗普总统发推文说，如果布莱西博士所说的是真的，她早在好多年前就会报警了。但我理解这两名女性为什么会在这么多年里不把事情说出去，也没有报警。多年来，我也一直是这样做的。直到上周五，我才在Twitter上讲述了那么多年前发生在我身上的事情。\r\n\nYou may want to know if I had been drinking on the night of my rape. It doesn’t matter, but I was not drunk. Maybe you will want to know what I was wearing or if I had been ambiguous about my desires. It still doesn’t matter, but I was wearing a long-sleeved, black Betsey Johnson maxi dress that revealed only my shoulders.\r\n\n你可能想知道我被强奸的那天晚上是不是喝酒了。那无关紧要，但我没喝醉。也许你想知道我穿了什么衣服，或者我是否对自己的欲望模棱两可。这也无关紧要，但我穿的是一件长袖的黑色特西·约翰逊(Betsey Johnson)及踝连衣裙，只露出了我的肩膀。\r\n\nThe two of us had gone to a couple of parties. Afterward, we went to his apartment. While we were talking, I was so tired that I lay on the bed and fell asleep.\r\n\n那天晚上我们两人参加了几个派对。之后，我们去了他的公寓。我们谈话的时候，我感到特别累，就躺在床上睡着了。\r\n\nThe next thing I remember is waking up to a very sharp stabbing pain like a knife blade between my legs. He was on top of me. I asked, “What are you doing?” He said, “It will only hurt for a while.” “Please don’t do this,” I screamed.\r\n\n我记得的接下来的事情是，我被一种剧烈的疼痛弄醒了，好像有把刀子插进了我的两腿之间。他压在我身上。我问，“你在干什么？”他说，“只会疼一小会儿。”我尖叫道，“请不要这样做。”\r\n\nThe pain was excruciating, and as he continued, my tears felt like fear.\r\n\n疼痛难以忍受，当他继续下去时，我的眼泪更像是恐惧。\r\n\nAfterward, he said, “I thought it would hurt less if you were asleep.” Then he drove me home.\r\n\n完事后，他说，“我以为如果你睡着了的话，就不会那么疼了。”然后他开车送我回家。\r\n\nI didn’t report it. Not to my mother, not to my friends and certainly not to the police. At first I was in shock. That evening, I let my mother know when I was home, then went to sleep, hoping to forget that night.\r\n\n我没有告诉任何人。没有告诉我妈，没有告诉我的朋友们，当然也没有报警。起初我感到惊魂未定。那天晚上，我先是让我妈知道我回来了，然后就去睡觉，我希望能忘记发生的事情。\r\nscript async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\">\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nSoon I began to feel that it was my fault. We had no language in the 1980s for date rape. I imagined that adults would say: “What the hell were you doing in his apartment? Why were you dating someone so much older?”\r\n\n不久，我开始觉得那是我的错。20世纪80年代时，我们还没有关于约会强奸的说法。我想象大人们会问：“你到底去他的公寓里干什么？你为什么和比你大这么多岁的人约会？”\r\n\nI don’t think I classified it as rape — or even sex — in my head. I’d always thought that when I lost my virginity, it would be a big deal — or at least a conscious decision. The loss of control was disorienting. In my mind, when I one day had intercourse, it would be to express love, to share pleasure or to have a baby. This was clearly none of those things.\r\n\n在我的脑海里，我没有把它当作强奸，甚至当作性交。我一直以为，失去童贞是一件很大的事情——或者至少是一个有意识的决定。失去控制让人无所适从。在我的脑海里，当我有一天发生性交时，那会是为了表达爱、分享快乐或是为了要一个孩子。那次显然都不是这些。\r\n\nLater, when I had other boyfriends my senior year of high school and in my first year of college, I lied to them — I said I was still a virgin. Emotionally, I still was.\r\n\n后来，当我在高中最后一年和大学第一年有了其他男朋友时，我对他们撒了谎——我说我仍是处女。在情感上，我仍然是。\r\n\nWhen I think about it now, I realize that by the time of this rape, I had already absorbed certain lessons. When I was 7 years old, my stepfather’s relative touched me between my legs and put my hand on his erect penis. Shortly after I told my mother and stepfather, they sent me to India for a year to live with my grandparents. The lesson was: If you speak up, you will be cast out.\r\n\n当我现在回想起那件事时，我意识到，到我被强奸的时候，我已经吸取了某种教训。在我七岁的时候，我继父的亲戚曾把手伸到我的两腿之间，还把我的手放在他勃起的阴茎上。就在我把这件事告诉了我的母亲和继父之后不久，他们把我送回印度与我的祖父母住了一年。教训是：如果你说出来，你将被赶出去。\r\n\nThese experiences have affected me and my ability to trust. It took me decades to talk about this with intimate partners and a therapist.\r\n\n这些经历影响了我、以及我与他人建立信任的能力。几十年后，我才能与亲密的伴侣和治疗师讨论这个问题。\r\n\nSome say a man shouldn’t pay a price for an act he committed as a teenager. But the woman pays the price for the rest of her life, and so do the people who love her.\r\n\n有人说，一个男人不应该为他十几岁时的行为付出代价。但是，女人要用她的余生付出代价，爱她的人也如此。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nI think if I had at the time named what happened to me as rape — and told others — I might have suffered less. Looking back, I now think I let my rapist off the hook and I let my 16-year-old self down.\r\n\n我想，如果我在当时就把发生在我身上的事情定为强奸，并且告诉了其他人的话，我可能会少受些折磨。现在回想起来，我觉得我让强奸我的那个人逍遥法外了，我让16岁的自己失望了。\r\n\nI have a daughter now. She’s 8. For years I’ve been telling her the simplest and most obvious words that it took me much of my life to understand: “If anybody touches you in your privates or makes you feel uncomfortable, you yell loud. You get out of there and tell somebody. Nobody is allowed to put their hands on you. Your body is yours.”\r\n\n我现在有一个女儿。她八岁了。多年来，我一直对她说一些最简单、最明显的话，这些话是我花了很长时间才明白的：“如果有人碰你的私处，或者让你感到不舒服，你就大声喊叫。你马上离开，把发生的事情告诉别人。不许任何人把手放在你身上。你的身体是属于你的。”\r\n\nNow, 32 years after my rape, I am stating publicly what happened. I have nothing to gain by talking about this. But we all have a lot to lose if we put a time limit on telling the truth about sexual assault and if we hold on to the codes of silence that for generations have allowed men to hurt women with impunity.\r\n\n如今，在我被强奸32年后，我公开讲述了发生的事情。我谈这件事对我没有任何好处。但是，如果我们对讲述性侵的真相设定一个时间限制，如果我们坚守沉默的准则——几代人以来，这种准则一直让男性伤害女性而不受惩罚——我们所有的人都会蒙受很大的损失。\r\n\nOne in four girls and one in six boys today will be sexually abused before the age of 18. I am speaking now because I want us all to fight so that our daughters never know this fear and shame and our sons know that girls’ bodies do not exist for their pleasure and that abuse has grave consequences.\r\n\n如今，每四个女孩中就有一个、每六个男孩中就有一个会在18岁前遭受性虐待。我现在说出来，因为我想让我们所有的人都与之作斗争，让我们的女儿们永远不会知道这种恐惧和耻辱，让我们的儿子知道女孩子的身体不是为他们的快乐而存在的，虐待女性是有严重后果的。\r\n\nThose messages should be very clear as we consider whom we appoint to make decisions on the highest court of our land.\r\n\n在我们考虑我们将任命谁来在我们国土的最高法院做裁决的时候，这些信息应该十分清晰。\r\n\nPadma Lakshmi (@PadmaLakshmi) 是“顶级厨师”(Top Chef)节目的主持人和执行制片人，出版过“Love, Loss and What We Ate” 等数本书，同时是美国公民自由联盟(A.C.L.U.)的移民及女性权益大使。\r\n"
