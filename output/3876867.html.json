Instead, she made headlines in China on Thursday after reporting an armed raid and kidnapping.\n\"I was not scared because the police arrived very quickly,\" said Li, an editor from Western China Metropolis Daily in Chengdu, Sichuan province, who was staying at a resort in the easternmost Malaysian state. \"I felt angry at the kidnappers and what they had done. And I was disappointed that my honeymoon was ruined.\"\nLi was the first Chinese witness to report the incident in which six gunmen stormed the resort and abducted two women - a 29-year-old Chinese tourist and a 40-year-old hotel worker from the Philippines. The gunmen escaped in a speedboat.\nLi said she was about to go to bed when she heard women screaming and the sounds of people scattering in panic.\nA few moments later, Li, whose room was only a few meters away from the abduction, heard a speedboat engine rev up and then fade into the night. With her husband and two friends, Li had arrived four days earlier on her first visit to Malaysia.\nAbout 10 minutes after the incident, she said, the hotel asked about 60 guests, including senior citizens and children, to gather in the canteen, where the abduction was explained.\nWhen they learned that the resort had been raided and armed men may still be in the vicinity, the guests lay on the floor, Li said.\nHotel workers later helped Li and the guests get to safe places in the nearby town or at the airport.\nAlmost all the guests left or planned to leave ahead of schedule, but Li said she would stay in Malaysia as planned until April 7.\nOn Thursday, when she should have been enjoying her honeymoon, she was filing news reports and giving interviews to many Chinese news organizations.\n\"Maybe I will not visit Malaysia anymore, at least not Sabah,\" she said. \"It's too close to the Philippines.\"\nSabah is a popular destination for Chinese tourists, but it faces persistent security problems because of its proximity to the restive southern Philippines.\nInsurgents occupying nearby islands have carried out similar kidnappings of tourists in the region before, seeking ransom.\n 查看译文\n中国日报4月4日电（记者赵盛楠）30岁的新闻工作者李雪早已计划好远离两个月的工作压力，在沙巴州的阳光下度过一个轻松愉快的蜜月。然而，在报道了一场持械抢劫和绑架案后，她在4月3日上了中国报纸的头版头条。\n“由于警察很快就到了现场，所以我当时并不害怕，”来自四川省成都的华西都市报编辑李说道，她此时正在马来西亚最东部的一个度假胜地，“我对这些绑架者和他们的所作所为感到很生气，同时我的蜜月被毁了让我很失望。”\n李是报道这起绑架案的首个中国目击者。在这起案件中，来自菲律宾的六人持械抢劫了一家度假酒店并绑走了两名女性，一名是来自中国的29岁游客，还有一名酒店工作人员。绑匪随后驾驶快艇逃走。\n李说在她将要睡觉的时候，听到了妇女的尖叫以及人们在恐慌中四处乱窜的声音。\n几分钟后，李在距离绑架现场不远的房间听到快艇的引擎加快转速并消失在夜里的声音。四天前，她和丈夫及两个朋友第一次来到了马来西亚。\n她说，事发十分钟后，酒店人员就把包括成年人和孩子在内的60名客人召集在了餐厅，向大家解释了绑架事件。\n当大家了解到这个度假胜地已经遭受袭击并且持械人员还有可能在附近时，客人们都伏在了地上，李说道。\n之后，酒店的工作人员帮助李及其他的客人转移到了附近的城镇或机场等相对安全的地区。\n几乎所有的客人都提前离开了，有的也计划将日程提前，但李说她会按之前的计划一直待到4月7号。\n4月3日，在她本应该享受蜜月的时候，她却在写新闻报道和接受各家中国新闻媒体的采访。\n“我可能不会再来马来西亚了，至少不会再来沙巴州，”她说道，“这里离菲律宾太近了。”\n沙巴州是比较受中国游客喜爱的旅游地区，但由于它靠近不安定的菲律宾南部，时刻面临着安全问题。\n叛乱分子占领了附近的岛屿，他们曾经在这个地区制造过类似的绑架游客的事件，以此来索要赎金。"
