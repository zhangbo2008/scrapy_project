It was disgusting.\"\n　　Gary Wilson, director of business operations at the zoo said the birds have been particularly interested in the pandas ever since they arrived at their new home.\n　　\"[They're] extremely curious birds, they often gather next to the wall to see what's happening below. We're hoping it's not a case of monochrome jealousy, but one or two of our rockhoppers seem to have had surprisingly good aim,\" Mr Wilson said.\n　　Most of those unfortunate enough to cop the brunt of the poo pelting have laughed it off, however, the zoo plans to install a glass panel to protect visitors from future attacks.\n　　【新闻快讯】\n　　动物也和人一样，当发现有其他动物比自己更加受关注和喜爱的时候，会羡慕、嫉妒，进而进行无差别攻击。日前，在英国爱丁堡动物园就发生了这么一起“因嫉妒引发的粪弹风波”。\n　　“甜甜”和“阳光”是上月刚抵达英国爱丁堡动物园开始新生活的两只中国大熊猫。当地民众及其喜爱这两只大熊猫，前往动物园观看熊猫的人数也不断攀升。但它们的受宠却招来了邻居企鹅的嫉妒。这些善妒的跳岩企鹅竟然朝排队观看大熊猫的人群投“粪弹”。\n　　相关人员回忆了当时的情况，他们正在排队看熊猫，突然前面的一个男人惊讶地尖叫起来，原来他的夹克被一大团企鹅粪便击中了。\n　　据爱丁堡动物园负责人介绍，这些跳岩企鹅之所以有如此举动，可能是患了“黑白嫉妒”症。企鹅的家就在“甜甜”和“阳光”新家的旁边，自熊猫来此定居以来，企鹅每天都会饶有兴趣地盯着熊猫馆。“这些企鹅的好奇心真地很重，它们经常聚集到墙边，密切注视着熊猫馆的一切。”看着同样是“黑白配”的邻居门前总是人来人往，企鹅们大概觉得自己受到了冷落，嫉妒之情也由此而生。\n　　据悉，目前这些企鹅们只发动过一次“粪弹”袭击，而且大多数游人对此也都只是一笑置之。不过，据爱丁堡动物园业务运营部门主任威尔逊说，为了防止类似事件再度发生，动物园正在考虑在企鹅的家周围安装玻璃板。\n　　看来企鹅的脾气也够大啊，提醒大家去看企鹅的时候可要小心“粪弹”袭击啊。"
