"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump forced out Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday, ending a partnership that soured almost from the start of the administration and degenerated into one of the most acrimonious public standoffs between a commander in chief and a senior Cabinet member in modern U.S. history.\r\n\n华盛顿——唐纳德·特朗普总统于周三迫使司法部长杰夫·塞申斯(Jeff Sessions)下台，结束了双方的伙伴关系，几乎从该政府伊始，这段关系就陷入困境，沦为美国历史上最高统帅和内阁高级成员之间最激烈的公开僵局之一。\r\n\nSessions’ resignation, made at the president’s request, was being delivered to John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff. It came just a day after midterm elections in which Democrats captured control of the House, but Republican success in holding onto the Senate and building their slim majority may make it easier for the president to confirm a successor.\r\n\n在总统的要求下，塞申斯的辞呈交给了特朗普的幕僚长约翰·凯利(John Kelly)。中期选举中，民主党控制了众议院，但共和党成功保住了参议院，并获得微弱多数，此事选在选举随后一天，可能会使总统更容易确认继任者。\r\n\n“Dear Mr. President, at your request I am submitting my resignation,” Sessions said in his letter.\r\n\n“尊敬的总统先生，应你的要求，我递交辞呈，”塞申斯在信中说。\r\n\nMatthew Whitaker, Sessions’ chief of staff, will take over as acting attorney general, Trump said in a tweet announcing the shake-up.\r\n\n特朗普在宣布这一人员变动的推文中表示，塞申斯的办公室主任马修·惠特克(Matthew Whitaker)将担任代理司法部长。\r\n\n“We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!” he wrote. “A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.”\r\n\n“我们感谢司法部长杰夫·塞申斯的服务，祝他顺利！”他写道。“将在以后提名永久替代人选。”\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\rHis resignation came barely an hour after a news conference in which Trump was asked whether Sessions and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, still had job security. He dodged the question. “I’d rather answer that at a little bit different time,” the president said.\r\n\n塞申斯辞职不到一小时前，在新闻发布会上，特朗普被问及塞申斯和副司法部长罗德·J·罗森斯坦(Rod J. Rosenstein)的工作是否还能保住。他回避了这个问题。 “我宁愿在另一个时间回答这个问题，”总统说。\r\n\nTrump has regularly attacked the Justice Department and Sessions, blaming the attorney general for the specter of the special counsel investigation into ties between Trump’s campaign and Russia.\r\n\n特朗普经常攻击司法部和塞申斯，指责司法部长引来了对特朗普竞选与俄罗斯关系的特别检察官调查这个阴影。\r\n\nTrump has said for months that he wished to replace Sessions, but lawmakers and administration officials believed that firing the attorney general before the midterm elections would have had negative consequences for Republicans in tight races. So it came as little surprise when Sessions’ resigned the day after the midterms were over.\r\n\n\r\n司法部长杰夫·塞申斯是唐纳德·J·特朗普总统最早期、最有力的支持者之一。\n\r\n\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump forced out Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday, ending a partnership that soured almost from the start of the administration and degenerated into one of the most acrimonious public standoffs between a commander in chief and a senior Cabinet member in modern U.S. history.\r\n\n华盛顿——唐纳德·特朗普总统于周三迫使司法部长杰夫·塞申斯(Jeff Sessions)下台，结束了双方的伙伴关系，几乎从该政府伊始，这段关系就陷入困境，沦为美国历史上最高统帅和内阁高级成员之间最激烈的公开僵局之一。\r\n\nSessions’ resignation, made at the president’s request, was being delivered to John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff.

So it came as little surprise when Sessions’ resigned the day after the midterms were over.\r\n\n\r\n司法部长杰夫·塞申斯是唐纳德·J·特朗普总统最早期、最有力的支持者之一。\n特朗普几个月来一直表示他希望撤换塞申斯，但立法者和政府官员认为，在中期选举之前解雇司法部长，会在激烈的竞争中对共和党人产生负面影响。所以塞申斯在中期结束后的第二天辞职，并不令人意外。\r\n\nThe deputy attorney general, now Rosenstein, would normally be in line to become the acting attorney general, but Trump has complained publicly about Rosenstein, too. Since Sessions is recused from all election-related matters, Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia.\r\n\n现任司法部副部长的罗森斯坦通常会轮候成为代理司法部长，但特朗普也曾公开抱怨过罗森斯坦。由于塞申斯被要求回避所有与选举有关的事物，罗森斯坦负责监督特别检察官罗伯特·穆勒(Robert Mueller)，后者正在调查特朗普竞选活动与俄罗斯之间的互动。\r\n\nAs attorney general, Sessions made a forceful mark on the Justice Department. He rolled back some of President Barack Obama’s signature policies as he encouraged federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible charges and sentences against criminal suspects. He successfully advised Trump to rescind Obama’s program protecting nearly 700,000 young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. He sued California over its sanctuary laws and targeted states that legalized marijuana.\r\n\n作为司法部长，塞申斯在司法部留下了强有力的印记。他取消了贝拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)总统的一些标志性政策，还鼓励联邦检察官对犯罪嫌疑人采取最严厉的指控和判决。他成功地建议特朗普取消奥巴马保护近70万在儿童时期非法入境的年轻移民的计划。他还起诉加利福尼亚州的庇护法，并指责那些使大麻合法化的州。\r\n\nRebecca R.
