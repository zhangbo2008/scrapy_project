For most of my adult life, my weight stayed the same no matter how much I ate or didn鈥檛 work out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I turned 35 (three years ago), and my metabolism started to slow. At first, I blamed the clothes dryer when my pants no longer fit, but I couldn鈥檛 deny time for long. I knew I had to start exercising.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only problem was, I couldn鈥檛. I have such a pathetic inability to focus that I get bored with running while I鈥檓 putting on my sneakers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a tech columnist, I followed my first instinct and turned to technology, including fitness bands like Nike Fuelband and Jawbone Up, but none worked. These devices seemed to be better at marketing than motivating me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I switched to iPhone apps, including RunKeeper, which tracked my paltry runs, and the 7 Minute Workout, which was seven minutes too long. None of those could combat my immense boredom.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution, perhaps not surprisingly, was to get as far away from technology as I could.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried surfing and rock climbing, which kept me somewhat engaged, but the real answer, at least for me, was tai chi, a Chinese martial art that mixes graceful motions with meditation. (If boxing and yoga had a baby, it might look like tai chi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI explored group classes, but found it best to start by taking private lessons with Master Qichen Guo, who said he immediately recognized that my 鈥渕ind was too busy鈥� and that it could be 鈥渃almed鈥� through tai chi. I was skeptical, but Mr. Guo turned out to be right.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I focused on learning the balancing movements, the distractions seemed to float away, including the catcalls in my head to check Twitter every nanosecond. (My teacher also demonstrated how he could throw me to the floor with barely any effort.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are (surprisingly) few apps for tai chi, but there are thousands of (mostly low-quality) YouTube videos.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet it turned out I would be able to combine exercise and technology after all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo practice at home, Mr. Guo told me to use my smartphone to record his movements so I could watch and imitate them between lessons.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is working out well, though I have to put my smartphone in airplane mode, or I鈥檒l get distracted by the Internet.\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圢ICK BILTON锛�\r\nCall me lazy, but I鈥檓 not big on exercise.
