The brothers had grown up playing together, they had been in the newspaper business together, they had built an airplane together. They even said they 鈥渢hought together.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are our images of creativity: filled with harmony. Innovation, we think, is something magical that happens when people find synchrony together. The melodies of Rodgers blend with the lyrics of Hammerstein. It鈥檚 why one of the cardinal rules of brainstorming is 鈥渨ithhold criticism.鈥� You want people to build on one another鈥檚 ideas, not shoot them down. But that鈥檚 not how creativity really happens.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Wright brothers said they thought together, what they really meant is that they argued together. One of their pivotal decisions was the design of a propeller for their plane. They squabbled for weeks, often shouting back and forth for hours. 鈥淎fter long arguments we often found ourselves in the ludicrous position of each having been converted to the other鈥檚 side,鈥� Orville reflected, 鈥渨ith no more agreement than when the discussion began.鈥� Only after thoroughly decimating each other鈥檚 arguments did it dawn on them that they were both wrong. They needed not one but two propellers, which could be spun in opposite directions to create a kind of rotating wing. 鈥淚 don鈥檛 think they really got mad,鈥� their mechanic marveled, 鈥渂ut they sure got awfully hot.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skill to get hot without getting mad 鈥� to have a good argument that doesn鈥檛 become personal 鈥� is critical in life. But it鈥檚 one that few parents teach to their children. We want to give kids a stable home, so we stop siblings from quarreling and we have our own arguments behind closed doors. Yet if kids never get exposed to disagreement, we鈥檒l end up limiting their creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe鈥檝e known groupthink is a problem for a long time: We鈥檝e watched ill-fated wars unfold after dissenting voices were silenced. But teaching kids to argue is more important than ever. Now we live in a time when voices that might offend are silenced on college campuses, when politics has become an untouchable topic in many circles, even more fraught than religion or race. We should know better: Our legal system is based on the idea that arguments are necessary for justice. For our society to remain free and open, kids need to learn the value of open disagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt turns out that highly creative adults often grow up in families full of tension. Not fistfights or personal insults, but real disagreements. When adults in their early 30s were asked to write imaginative stories, the most creative ones came from those whose parents had the most conflict a quarter-century earlier. Their parents had clashing views on how to raise children. They had different values and attitudes and interests. And when highly creative architects and scientists were compared with their technically skilled but less original peers, the innovators often had more friction in their families. As the psychologist Robert Albert put it, 鈥渢he creative person-to-be comes from a family that is anything but harmonious, one with a 鈥榳obble.鈥� 鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nWilbur and Orville Wright came from a wobbly family. Their father, a preacher, never met a moral fight he wasn鈥檛 willing to pick. They watched him clash with school authorities who weren鈥檛 fond of his decision to let his kids miss a half-day of school from time to time to learn on their own. Their father believed so much in embracing arguments that despite being a bishop in the local church, he had multiple books by atheists in his library 鈥� and encouraged his children to read them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we rarely see a spat, we learn to shy away from the threat of conflict. Witnessing arguments 鈥� and participating in them 鈥� helps us grow a thicker skin. We develop the will to fight uphill battles and the skill to win those battles, and the resilience to lose a battle today without losing our resolve tomorrow. For the Wright brothers, argument was the family trade and a fierce one was something to be savored. Conflict was something to embrace and resolve. 鈥淚 like scrapping with Orv,鈥� Wilbur said.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wright brothers weren鈥檛 alone. The Beatles fought over instruments and lyrics and melodies. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony clashed over the right way to win the right to vote. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak argued incessantly while designing the first Apple computer. None of these people succeeded in spite of the drama 鈥� they flourished because of it. Brainstorming groups generate 16 percent more ideas when the members are encouraged to criticize one another. The most creative ideas in Chinese technology companies and the best decisions in American hospitals come from teams that have real disagreements early on. Breakthrough labs in microbiology aren鈥檛 full of enthusiastic collaborators cheering one another on but of skeptical scientists challenging one another鈥檚 interpretations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf no one ever argues, you鈥檙e not likely to give up on old ways of doing things, let alone try new ones. Disagreement is the antidote to groupthink. We鈥檙e at our most imaginative when we鈥檙e out of sync. There鈥檚 no better time than childhood to learn how to dish it out 鈥� and to take it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Samuel Johnson was growing up, his parents argued constantly. He described a family as 鈥渁 little kingdom, torn with factions and exposed to revolutions.鈥� He went on to write one of the greatest dictionaries in history, one that had a lasting impact on the English language and wasn鈥檛 supplanted until the Oxford English Dictionary appeared more than a century later. Who would be more motivated and qualified to clean up a messy language than someone whose household was filled with it?\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren need to learn the value of thoughtful disagreement. Sadly, many parents teach kids that if they disagree with someone, it鈥檚 polite to hold their tongues. Rubbish. What if we taught kids that silence is bad manners? It disrespects the other person鈥檚 ability to have a civil argument 鈥� and it disrespects the value of your own viewpoint and your own voice. It鈥檚 a sign of respect to care enough about someone鈥檚 opinion that you鈥檙e willing to challenge it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can also help by having disagreements openly in front of our kids. Most parents hide their conflicts: They want to present a united front, and they don鈥檛 want kids to worry. But when parents disagree with each other, kids learn to think for themselves. They discover that no authority has a monopoly on truth. They become more tolerant of ambiguity. Rather than conforming to others鈥� opinions, they come to rely on their own independent judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt doesn鈥檛 seem to matter how often parents argue; what counts is how they handle arguments when they happen. Creativity tends to flourish, Mr. Albert, the psychologist, found, in families that are 鈥渢ense but secure.鈥� In a recent study of children ages 5 to 7, the ones whose parents argued constructively felt more emotionally safe. Over the next three years, those kids showed greater empathy and concern for others. They were friendlier and more helpful toward their classmates in school.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to prevent arguments, we should be modeling courteous conflict and teaching kids how to have healthy disagreements. We can start with four rules:\r\n\r\n\r\no Frame it as a debate, rather than a conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\no Argue as if you鈥檙e right but listen as if you鈥檙e wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\no Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person鈥檚 perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\no Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you鈥檝e learned from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood arguments are wobbly: a team or family might rock back and forth but it never tips over. If kids don鈥檛 learn to wobble, they never learn to walk; they end up standing still.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam Grant is a professor of management and psychology at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the author of 鈥淥riginals: How Non-Conformists Move the World鈥� and a contributing opinion writer.\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛堜簹褰撀锋牸鍏扮壒锛�\r\nWhen Wilbur and Orville Wright finished their flight at Kitty Hawk, Americans celebrated the brotherly bond.

Sadly, many parents teach kids that if they disagree with someone, it鈥檚 polite to hold their tongues. Rubbish. What if we taught kids that silence is bad manners? It disrespects the other person鈥檚 ability to have a civil argument 鈥� and it disrespects the value of your own viewpoint and your own voice. It鈥檚 a sign of respect to care enough about someone鈥檚 opinion that you鈥檙e willing to challenge it.\r\n\r\n\r\n瀛╁瓙浠渶瑕佺煡閬撴湁鎬濇兂鐨勫垎姝х殑浠峰�笺�備笉骞哥殑鏄紝璁稿鐖舵瘝鏁欏瀛╁瓙锛屽鏋滀粬浠笉鍚屾剰鍒汉鐨勮鐐癸紝閭ｄ箞灏卞簲璇ョぜ璨屽湴淇濇寔娌夐粯銆傝儭璇淬�傛垜浠簲璇ユ暀瀵煎瀛愶紝娌夐粯鏄笉绀艰矊鐨勩�傝繖鏄笉灏婇噸浠栦汉鍏峰鏂囨槑杈╄鐨勮兘鍔涳紝涓嶅皧閲嶄綘鑷繁鐨勮鐐瑰拰澹伴煶鐨勪环鍊笺�傚湪涔庡埆浜虹殑瑙傜偣銆佹効鎰忓幓鎸戞垬瀹冿紝鏄皧閲嶄粬浜虹殑涓�绉嶈〃鐜般��\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can also help by having disagreements openly in front of our kids. Most parents hide their conflicts: They want to present a united front, and they don鈥檛 want kids to worry. But when parents disagree with each other, kids learn to think for themselves. They discover that no authority has a monopoly on truth. They become more tolerant of ambiguity. Rather than conforming to others鈥� opinions, they come to rely on their own independent judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n鎴戜滑鍦ㄥ瀛愰潰鍓嶅叕寮�琛ㄨ揪鍒嗘涔熸槸鏈夌泭鐨勩�傚ぇ澶氭暟鐖舵瘝闅愯棌浠栦滑鐨勫啿绐侊細浠栦滑鎯宠瀛╁瓙浠湅鍒扮埗姣嶇殑鎯虫硶涓�鑷达紝涓嶆兂璁╀粬浠媴蹇冦�備絾鏄紝褰撶埗姣嶆剰瑙佷笉涓�鑷存椂锛屽瀛愪滑鑳藉浼氱嫭绔嬫�濊�冦�備粬浠細鍙戠幇锛屽苟涓嶅瓨鍦ㄦ帉鎻″叏閮ㄧ湡鐞嗙殑鏉冨▉銆備粬浠姝т箟鏈夋洿澶氬寘瀹广�備粬浠笉浼氱洸鐩伒浠庡埆浜虹殑鎰忚锛岃�屾槸渚濋潬鑷繁鐨勭嫭绔嬪垽鏂��\r\n\r\n\r\nIt doesn鈥檛 seem to matter how often parents argue; what counts is how they handle arguments when they happen. Creativity tends to flourish, Mr. Albert, the psychologist, found, in families that are 鈥渢ense but secure.鈥� In a recent study of children ages 5 to 7, the ones whose parents argued constructively felt more emotionally safe. Over the next three years, those kids showed greater empathy and concern for others. They were friendlier and more helpful toward their classmates in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n鐖舵瘝浜夎鐨勯鐜囦技涔庢棤鍏崇揣瑕侊紱閲嶈鐨勬槸浠栦滑濡備綍杩涜浜夎銆傚績鐞嗗瀹惰壘浼壒鍙戠幇锛屽湪鈥滅揣寮犱絾瀹夊叏鈥濈殑瀹跺涵涓紝鍒涢�犲姏寰�寰�浼氳摤鍕冨彂灞曘�傚湪鏈�杩戠殑涓�椤归拡瀵�5鑷�7宀佸効绔ョ殑鐮旂┒涓紝鍦ㄧ埗姣嶈兘澶熻繘琛屽缓璁炬�т簤璁虹殑瀹跺涵閲岋紝瀛╁瓙浠湪鎯呮劅涓婃劅瑙夋洿瀹夊叏銆傚湪涔嬪悗鐨勪笁骞撮噷锛岄偅浜涘瀛愭洿鍏冲績浠栦汉锛屾洿鏈夊悓鎯呭績銆備粬浠湪瀛︽牎閲屽鍚屽鏇村弸濂斤紝鏇翠箰浜庡府蹇欍��\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to prevent arguments, we should be modeling courteous conflict and teaching kids how to have healthy disagreements.
