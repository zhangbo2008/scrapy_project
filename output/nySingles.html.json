Wang Xin, 24, an engineer in Shanghai, said he had rediscovered the joys of shopping offline.\r\n\n26岁的杨荪来自北方城市西安，她说，“双11”的折扣不再足以说服她等待一整年去购买她想要的东西。24岁的王辛是上海一名工程师，他说他重新发现了线下购物的乐趣。\r\n\n“Singles Day just doesn’t hold that much appeal for me,” Mr. Wang said.\r\n\n“所以‘双11’对我来说就更没啥意思了，”王辛说。\r\n\nAsked about the current mood among Chinese consumers, Joseph C. Tsai, Alibaba’s executive vice chairman, told reporters on Sunday that Alibaba should be understood in the context of the epochal rise of China’s middle class.\r\n\n当被问及中国消费者目前的情绪时，阿里巴巴执行副主席蔡崇信于周日告诉记者，应该在中国中产阶级划时代崛起的背景下来看待阿里巴巴。\r\n\n“That trend is not going to stop, trade war or no trade war,” he said. “Any kind of short-term economic effects, we believe, will be cyclical.”\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\r\n“这种趋势不会停止，不管有没有贸易战，”他说。 “我们认为，任何短期经济影响都将是周期性的。”\r\n\nAlibaba is not like Amazon in that it is not a retailer. It merely provides the digital shelves and aisles for other merchants to sell their goods. But in its relentless ambition, Alibaba may be Amazon’s only global equal. Both companies want to fulfill their customers’ every desire and need.\r\n\n阿里巴巴和亚马逊不一样，因为它不是零售商。它只是为其他商家提供数字货架和通道来销售他们的商品。但在持续不断的野心方面，阿里巴巴可能是亚马逊在全球唯一势均力敌的对手。两家公司都希望满足客户的每个愿望和需求。\r\n\nAlready, people order dinner on Alibaba’s takeout app, buy groceries from Alibaba’s supermarkets, watch movies produced by Alibaba, navigate with Alibaba’s smartphone maps and rent computing power from Alibaba’s servers. And the company still wants to do more. It recently opened an unmanned hotel. It is making its own computer chips. It wants to promote African economic development and end world hunger.\r\n\n人们已经可以通过阿里巴巴的外卖应用程序订餐，从阿里巴巴的超市购买杂货，观看阿里巴巴制作的电影，用阿里巴巴的智能手机地图导航，以及从阿里巴巴的服务器租用云计算能力。该公司仍希望做得更多。它最近开了一家无人酒店。它正在制造自己的计算机芯片。它希望促进非洲经济发展和消除世界饥饿。\r\n\nThe business case for all this empire-building, Alibaba says, is that the company’s lakes of commercial data give it a leg up in anything that requires understanding customers or merchants.\r\n\n阿里巴巴表示，扩张的理由在于，该公司握有大量的商业数据，因此在任何需要了解客户或商家的事情上都占有优势。\r\n\nBut Wall Street is still waiting for results, and has grown skeptical in the meantime of the costs of expanding into new areas. Alibaba’s shares have lost nearly one-third their value since June.\r\n\n但华尔街仍在等待结果，对阿里巴巴进军新领域的成本越来越持怀疑态度。自6月以来，阿里巴巴股价已下跌近三分之一。\r\n\nSingles Day 2018 showed that Alibaba remains, if nothing else, China’s king of hype. During the broadcast event, the M.C.s periodically encouraged people watching at home to open up their phones and check out the great deals. As acrobats with Cirque du Soleil twirled in midair, the logo of Kukahome, a Chinese furniture maker, shone brightly behind them.\r\n\n2018年的“双11”表明，在中国，阿里巴巴就算不是别的，也仍然是炒作之王。在活动直播期间，主持人定期鼓励在家观看的人打开手机查看优惠。随着太阳马戏团的杂技演员在半空中旋转，中国家具制造商顾家家居的标识在他们身后闪闪发光。\r\n\nAt one point, the performer Liu Wei rapped out the specs of a new model of Skoda sport utility vehicle.\r\n\n在一个节目中，表演者刘伟（音）用说唱爆出了斯柯达运动型多功能车新车型的规格。\r\n\n\r\n位于北京郊区通州的自动化包装分拣机。在周日的中国年度购买狂潮的前90秒，网购者花费超过10亿美元。 \n\r\nAnna Lin, a 25-year-old who works in finance in Shanghai, said she was feeling more lukewarm about the whole thing than in years past. Singles Day is now just one of many big shopping festivals each year, she said.\r\n\n25岁的林安娜在上海从事金融工作，她表示，与过去几年相比，她对整件事感到更加冷淡。她说，“双11”现在只是每年的众多大型购物节之一。\r\n\nPlus, Ms. Lin said, the Singles Day promotions have become increasingly baroque. This year, there were coupons for specific items and brands, coupons that were available only at certain times of day, and coupons that appeared randomly and could be grabbed only by playing a game. Gathering friends into a team could help you collect even more coupons.\r\n\n此外，林安娜说，“双11”的促销活动变得越来越繁琐。今年，有特定商品和品牌的优惠券，仅在一天中的某些时间可用的优惠券，还有随机出现的优惠券，只能通过玩游戏来获取。让朋友们聚成一个团，可以帮你收集更多的优惠券。\r\n\n“That’s too much work,” Ms. Lin said. “It also isn’t worth it when you realize that after you’ve done all that, all you’ve got is 10 to 15 percent off, or even less.”\r\n\n“就是太麻烦了，不值得花那个功夫，”林安娜说。 “而且尤其是当你发现算了半天最后其实也就是打了个九折八五折这样，甚至可能还不到呢。”\r\n\nThe comedian Papi Jiang captured the feeling in a video skit that went viral last year. In the sketch, Ms. Jiang tries to wade through a mess of convoluted Singles Day promotions. She scribbles formulas on heaps of paper and a blackboard. She dashes her phone to the floor multiple times. She tries to do the calculations on an abacus, before realizing that she doesn’t know how to use an abacus.\r\n\n喜剧演员Papi酱去年一部走红的视频短片捕捉了这种感觉。她试图用草图理清一系列令人费解的“双11”促销活动。她在一堆纸和一块黑板上写公式，多次将手机扔到地板上，还试图用算盘进行计算，后来才意识到自己根本不知道怎么用算盘。\r\n\n“My time is more valuable than that,” Ms. Lin said. “I honestly think all the math is a way to hide the fact that there isn’t much of a discount.”\r\n\n“我的时间比省的钱值钱多了，”林安娜说。 “老实说，我甚至都觉得这么多给你设置这么多数学题，就是为了隐藏其实根本没优惠多少的事实。”\r\n\nAlibaba does not lack for other methods of subtle persuasion on Singles Day. If you had opened your Taobao shopping app on Sunday, you would have seen how your spending that day ranked against that of other people in your area.\r\n\n阿里巴巴在“双11”并不缺乏其他微妙劝说消费者的方式。如果你在周日打开淘宝购物应用程序，就会看到你当天的支出与你所在地区其他人的支出对比。\r\n\nThe company’s methods for ginning up excitement have come under scrutiny before. Two years ago, Alibaba said that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating it for the way it reports Singles Day sales. The company’s preferred metric, gross merchandise value, is supposed to represent the amount of money that changes hands on its platforms. But there is no standardized way of calculating it.\r\n\n该公司提高购物兴奋度的方法之前已受到详细审查。两年前，阿里巴巴表示，美国证券交易委员会(United States Securities and Exchange Commission)正在调查它报告“双11”销售额的方式。该公司的首选指标是商品总价值，应该代表在其平台上转手的金额。但是它没有标准化的计算方法。\r\n\nThe company has since de-emphasized the number. But the episode illustrated the way that Alibaba sees itself — as a company that breaks the mold.\r\n\n该公司此后不再强调这一数字。但这件事说明了阿里巴巴将自己视为一家打破常规的公司。\r\n\nEver since Alibaba listed its shares in New York four years ago, the company has used a sense of manifest destiny to beguile investors, stock analysts and an eager news media. China was on the long road to middle-class prosperity, the company said, and Alibaba had the biggest tollbooth. A bet on Alibaba was a bet on China itself.\r\n\n自阿里巴巴四年前在纽约上市以来，该公司一直使用一种明显的天命观来诱惑投资者、股票分析师和热切的新闻媒体。该公司表示，中国正走上中产阶级繁荣的漫长道路，而阿里巴巴则是这条路上最大的收费站。对阿里巴巴下注，就是对中国下注。\r\n\nLast year, when the data firm CB Insights asked people to vote for the company they would invest in and hold for 10 years, Alibaba was the winner, beating out every American tech giant as well as Saudi Aramco and Goldman Sachs.\r\n\n去年，当数据机构CB Insights要求人们投票选出他们将持有10年的公司投票时，阿里巴巴成为了赢家，击败了所有的美国科技巨头以及沙特阿拉伯国家石油公司(Saudi Aramco)和高盛银行(Goldman Sachs)。\r\n\nNow, though, it is clear that Alibaba’s privileged place in China’s rise is not guaranteed.\r\n\n但现在很明显，阿里巴巴在中国崛起中享有特权的地位并不能被保证。\r\n\nIn takeout delivery, for instance, Alibaba is facing off against several wealthy rivals. It has made big bets that have struggled, including on the troubled bike-rental company Ofo.\r\n\n例如，在外卖运送方面，阿里巴巴正与几个富有的竞争对手对抗。它已经尽力投下巨大的赌注，但未能成功，包括陷入困境的自行车租赁公司Ofo。\r\n\nOr consider Pinduoduo, an upstart e-commerce company that went from zero to 350 million customers in just three years. You may have not heard of the brands on the app, and you might not trust the quality of the goods. The prices, though, cannot be beat. Pinduoduo has won over shoppers in China’s smaller cities and towns.\r\n\n或者，想想拼多多，这个新兴的电子商务公司，它在短短三年间从零到现在的3.5亿客户。你可能没有听说过这个应用程序上的那些品牌，也可能不信任那些商品的质量。但价格无敌。拼多多赢得了中国小城镇的购物者。\r\n\nNo one expects Alibaba to generate whopper Singles Day sales growth numbers every year for eternity. At some point, when growth starts decelerating quickly, the event could change, to focus on one week’s sales instead of one day’s, or on something else entirely.\r\n\n没有人期望阿里巴巴能够永远在每年产生更高的“双11”销售增长数字。在某些时候，当增长开始快速降低时，事情会发生变化，转而开始专注于一周的销售而不是一天的销售，或者完全集中在其他方面。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\r\nAlibaba’s track record suggests that when the time comes, it will have no trouble pulling off another act of conjuring.\r\n\n阿里巴巴的记录显示，到那个时候，它会毫不费力地完成另一套魔术戏法。\r\n\n“I’m not worried about Alibaba at all,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm Pacific Epoch. “These guys are really good at creating things from nothing.”\r\n\n“我根本不担心阿里巴巴，”研究机构弘亚世代(Pacific Epoch)的上海分析师祝征宏说。“这些人真的擅长于从无到有创造事物。”\r\n\nRaymond Zhong是《纽约时报》驻北京记者。欢迎在Twitter上关注他@zhonggg。\r\n\r\n\nCarolyn Zhang对本文有研究贡献。\r\n"
