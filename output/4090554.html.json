It continues to tell the story of a boy who meets a girl when he gets lost and asks for direction.\n　　视频的开头我们听到特克在说：“我有422个朋友，但是我很孤单。” 接着视频讲述了一个迷路的男孩在问路的时候认识了一个女孩的故事。\n　　The two then become a couple, and the video shows them sharing romantic dinners, strolls through the countryside and laughs on the couch.\n　　他们成了一对，视频中可以看到他们俩共度浪漫晚餐，一起在乡村漫步，窝在沙发上嬉闹。\n　　The couple buy a house, get married and have a baby girl, who we see grow up and leave the nest. Their daughter later comes back, having married and had a baby herself and the pround grandfather clutches his grandson.\n　　他们买了房子，结婚了然后生了一个女孩，女儿渐渐长大，然后离开了家。后来女儿也回来了，结婚了也生了自己的孩子，这对祖父母身边有孙辈的陪伴。\n　　As his graying wife dies, she whispers about how 'she's happy she got stopped by that lost boy in the street'.\n　　白发苍苍的老太太告别人世时，在丈夫的耳边轻声说道“自己很开心当时在街上遇到了那个迷路的男孩。”\n　　But here's the catch - it never happened. The film then goes back the moment the boy would have asked for directions, and his 'future wife' is seen passing by as he looks at his phone - likely posing his question to Google Maps instead.\n　　但其实这一切都从未发生。短片回到当时男孩本来要问路的时刻，因为男孩只看着手机，他“未来的妻子” 与他擦身而过。迷路的男孩可能是在用谷歌地图找地点。\n　　Because, as Turk explains, 'when you're too busy looking down, you don't see the chances you miss.'\n　　特克解释说：“因为你永远都在忙着低头看手机，所以你看不到身边错过的机会。"
