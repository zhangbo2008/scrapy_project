Around the same time, he became interested in clothes and the way they are depicted through art.\n　　2006年至2008年他给一位美国雕塑家做学徒，开始尝试雕塑。这期间，他又对服饰以及服装的艺术表现形式产生了兴趣。“I started to play around with some flowing drapery forms and eventually started carving simple T-shirts and folded men’s dress shirts,” said 32-year-old Thomson.\n　　32岁的汤姆森说：“一开始我只雕刻有褶皱的布料，后来渐渐开始雕刻T恤和折叠的男士衬衫。\n美丽的大理石裙子：惟妙惟肖的雕刻艺术\n　　His latest work is a set of 12 sculptures that explore the way fabric hangs and folds and captures that lightness and gracefulness in stone.\n　　汤姆森的最新作品包括了12件雕塑，作品用石头展示了布料悬挂时的样子以及褶皱，抓住了布料轻盈和优雅的精髓。\n　　To complete the project, Thomson asked his friends and family to donate garments that he later used as models. The collection has already been displayed in London and New York, and is due to be exhibited in Hong Kong next week.\n　　为了完成作品，汤姆森将朋友和家人贡献的衣服作为模型。这一系列的作品已经在伦敦和纽约展出，下个星期将在香港展出。\n　　Thomson is now trying hard to raise the bar on his next collection. “I was thinking in far more ambitious ways, visualizing garments that were flowing and had lots of folds. ”\n　　汤姆森正努力筹备新作品。他说：“我的下一步构想更加大胆，我希望可以更加逼真地展现出衣服的流动感和褶皱。”"
