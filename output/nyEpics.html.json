"HONG KONG — Jin Yong, a literary giant of the Chinese-speaking world whose fantastical epic novels inspired countless film, television and video game adaptations and were read by generations of ethnic Chinese, died on Tuesday in Hong Kong. He was 94.\r\n\n香港——华语世界的文学巨匠金庸于上周二在香港去世，享年94岁。一代代华人读过他的奇幻历史小说，这些小说也改编成不计其数的电影、电视剧和电子游戏。\r\n\nHis death, at the Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital, was confirmed by Ming Pao, the prominent Hong Kong newspaper that Jin Yong helped establish and ran for decades. Chip Tsao, a writer and friend, said the cause of death was organ failure.\r\n\n《明报》确认了他在香港养和医院离世，这份香港著名的报纸由金庸参与创办，已运营数十年。金庸的好友、作家陶杰(Chip Tsao)说，死因是器官衰竭。\r\n\nJin Yong, the pen name of Louis Cha, was one of the most widely read 20th-century writers in the Chinese language. The panoramic breadth and depth of the fictional universes he created have been compared to J. R. R.

He helped us think beyond right and wrong, good and bad.”\r\n\n“读他的小说打开了我们的眼界，”香港科技大学当代中国文学教授刘剑梅在电话采访中说。“他的思维方式与当时中国大陆培养的那种方式如此不同。他帮助我们跳出是与非、好与坏去思考。”\r\n\n查良镛1924年3月10日出生在浙江海宁，是七个孩子中的老二。他的父亲查枢卿是一位受过教育的地主。他的母亲徐禄出自富裕的商贾人家。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\r\nJin Yong graduated from Soochow University’s law school in 1948. By then he had begun working as a journalist and translator for the newspaper Ta Kung Pao in Shanghai. In 1948 he moved with the newspaper to Hong Kong, which would become his home for the next seven decades.\r\n\n金庸1948年毕业于东吴大学法学院。此后他开始担任上海《大公报》的记者和翻译。1948年，他随报社迁至香港，这里成为他后来70年的家。\r\n\nHe retired from writing novels in 1972. He stepped down as chairman of the Ming Pao Enterprise Corporation in 1993.\r\n\n1972年，他封笔不再写小说。1993年，他辞去明报企业董事局主席的职务。\r\n\nJin Yong is survived by his third wife, Lam Lok Yi, and his children from his second marriage: a son, Andrew, and two daughters, Grace and Edna.\r\n\n金庸的在世亲人还有第三任妻子林乐怡，以及他与第二任妻子的孩子：儿子查传倜和两个女儿查传诗、查传讷。\r\n\nThis year, the first installment of Jin Yong’s popular trilogy, “Legends of the Condor Heroes,” was translated into English, by Anna Holmwood.\r\n\n今年，金庸备受欢迎的三部曲中的第一部《射雕英雄传》由郝玉青(Anna Holmwood)译成了英文。\r\n\nAmong readers of original Chinese versions, Jin Yong had no shortage of prominent fans. They include Jack Ma, the chairman of Alibaba, who at one point gave employees nicknames drawn from characters in the novels.\r\n\n金庸中文原版小说的读者当中不乏显赫的粉丝。阿里巴巴集团董事长马云就是其一，他曾用金庸小说中人物的名字给手下员工当绰号。\r\n\n\r\nClaire Fu自北京对本文有研究贡献。\r\n\n\r\n翻译：Hongyu\r\n"
