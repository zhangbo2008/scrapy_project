"By ANA SWANSON; APRIL 4, 2018\r\nWASHINGTON 鈥� The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will place a 25 percent tariff on Chinese products like flat-screen televisions, medical devices, aircraft parts and batteries, outlining more than 1,300 imported goods that will soon face levies as part of a sweeping trade measure aimed at penalizing China for its trade practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe move, which stems from a White House investigation into China鈥檚 use of pressure, intimidation and theft to obtain American technologies, is likely to inflame an already-simmering trade war between the countries. On Monday, China said it would slap tariffs on 128 American products in response to a separate White House plan to tax steel and aluminum from China and other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe products targeted by the White House are part of its plan to go after China鈥檚 dominance in cutting-edge technologies like semiconductors, electric vehicles and advanced medical products 鈥� industries that China is pursuing dominance in as part of an industrial plan known as 鈥淢ade in China 2025.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trump administration said that its analysts had identified products that benefit from these policies but refined the list to remove goods that were likely to cause disruptions to the United States economy or consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe list of goods excludes many Chinese-made consumer products available for sale at Target or Walmart, including clothing, shoes and toys. But it will most likely increase costs for American manufacturers that depend on imported parts because it concentrates heavily on machinery and high-tech components. The tariffs will be imposed on a total of $50 billion worth of Chinese products each year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe designation of targeted products will be followed by a comment period in which American companies can provide feedback to the Trump administration on the product choices. The administration will hold a public hearing on the submissions on May 15 in Washington, and companies will have until May 22 to file final objections.\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness groups, concerned about the effect on companies and workers, swiftly criticized the move.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淯nilaterally imposing $50 billion of new tariffs without a long-term strategy that leads to economic reforms in China will only hurt America鈥檚 businesses, workers, and families,鈥� the Business Roundtable, a corporate trade group, said in a statement. 鈥淚nstead, the administration should work with U.S. allies on an approach that advances meaningful reform in China without imposing significant harm on America鈥檚 economy.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe products targeted by the White House are part of an effort to go after China鈥檚 dominance in cutting-edge technologies like semiconductors, electric vehicles and advanced medical products 鈥� industries that China is pursuing dominance in as part of an industrial plan known as 鈥淢ade in China 2025.鈥� Credit Gilles Sabri茅/Bloomberg\r\nJay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that American manufacturers were concerned about the trade relationship with China, including intellectual property theft, counterfeit goods and unfair subsidies, but also that tariffs were not the best response.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in the United States condemned the tariffs. 鈥淪uch unilateralistic and protectionist action has gravely violated fundamental principles and values of the W.T.O.,鈥� the statement said. 鈥淚t serves neither China鈥檚 interest, nor U.S. interest, even less the interest of the global economy.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese would resort to 鈥渕easures of equal scale and strength against U.S. products in accordance with Chinese law,鈥� the statement said.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile many American companies say they are unfairly treated in China, they have rued the possibility of a trade war between the world鈥檚 two largest economies, and the economic harm it could cause, and have begun pushing back against the White House鈥檚 plans. China remains a crucial and growing market for companies like John Deere and Apple, as well as for soybean farmers and growers of other agricultural products.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial markets fell sharply on Monday as China imposed its own retaliatory tariffs on American products but regained most of their lost territory on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Trump, who has repeatedly promised tough action on China鈥檚 trade practices, said Tuesday that he intended to get along with China but that its unfair trade behavior had gone on too long. 鈥淚t鈥檚 not something we can live with,鈥� Mr. Trump said at the White House, adding, 鈥淚 campaigned on that.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump advisers have criticized past administrations for allowing China to receive the benefits of global trade while continuing to break the international trade rules imposed by organizations like the World Trade Organization 鈥� a charge China denies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the administration has struggled to persuade its critics that the kind of tough trade measures Mr. Trump favors can alter China鈥檚 behavior without tipping the world into a trade war and ultimately harming American workers and consumers. In addition to the tariffs, the White House is preparing to restrict Chinese investment in American technology and innovation, and to start a case against China at the World Trade Organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淭he administration is rightly focused on restoring equity and fairness in our trade relationship with China,鈥� said Myron Brilliant, an executive vice president and the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 鈥淗owever, imposing taxes on products used daily by American consumers and job creators is not the way to achieve those ends.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coalition for a Prosperous America, an organization that has supported the president鈥檚 trade agenda, called the China action a shift from 鈥渘a\"ive鈥� to 鈥渟trategic鈥� trade. 鈥淭he age of appeasement must end,鈥� said Paola Masman, the group鈥檚 media director.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the administration鈥檚 trade measures are prompting concern among many American companies, who are wary of Beijing鈥檚 response.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States鈥� largest exports to China last year were aircraft and aircraft parts, which totaled more than $16 billion, according to IHS Markit. These products featured heavily on Tuesday鈥檚 list, setting off fears that China could retaliate with similar penalties against American plane maker Boeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association, said the group was still reviewing the tariff list but would almost certainly file comments with the administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarming communities, one of the country鈥檚 largest exporters and a solid base for Mr. Trump, are among the most vulnerable. Chinese tariffs of 25 percent will particularly hurt American pork farmers, who sent more than $1 billion worth of products to China last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said American farmers were already struggling to make ends meet. 鈥淚ncreasing tariffs on exports will harm Iowa producers and undermine the rural economy,鈥� Ms. Ernst said. 鈥淚t鈥檚 my hope that we can pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness, rather than reduce our access to foreign markets.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nNatalie Kitroeff and Ben Casselman contributed reporting from New York, and Keith Bradsher from Shanghai.\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�4鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圢ATALIE KITROEFF锛�\r\n鍗庣洓椤库�斺�旂壒鏈楁櫘鏀垮簻鍛ㄤ簩琛ㄧず锛屽皢瀵圭數瀛愯Е鎽稿睆銆侀挗閾佹澘鏉愩�佸尰鐤楀櫒姊般�侀鏈洪浂閮ㄤ欢銆佺數姹犱互鍙婂叾浠栦腑鍥戒骇鍝佸緛鏀�25%鐨勫叧绋庛�備綔涓哄ぇ瑙勬ā璐告槗鎺柦鐨勪竴閮ㄥ垎锛屾斂搴滄嫙瀹氱殑1000澶氶」杩涘彛鍟嗗搧閮藉嵆灏嗚寰佹敹鍏崇◣锛屾棬鍦ㄦ儵缃氫腑鍥界殑璐告槗琛屼负銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n璇ヨ鍔ㄧ紭璧蜂簬鐧藉灏变腑鍥藉埄鐢ㄥ帇鍔涖�佹亹鍚撳強鐩楃獌鎵嬫鑾峰彇缇庡浗鎶�鏈睍寮�鐨勮皟鏌ワ紝寰堝彲鑳界偣鐕冧袱鍥戒箣闂磋搫鍔垮凡涔呯殑璐告槗鎴樸�傚懆涓�锛屼腑鍥借〃绀哄皢瀵�128椤圭編鍥戒骇鍝佸緛鏀跺叧绋庯紝浠ュ簲瀵圭櫧瀹彟涓�椤瑰杩涘彛鑷腑鍥藉拰鍏朵粬鍥藉鐨勯挗閾濅骇鍝佸緛绋庣殑璁″垝銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鐧藉鐬勫噯鐨勮繖浜涗骇鍝佺鍚堝畠甯屾湜鍦ㄤ腑鍥藉崰鎹富瀵肩殑灏栫鎶�鏈鍩熷唴鍙栬儨鐨勮鍒掞紝濡傚崐瀵间綋銆佺數鍔ㄦ苯杞﹀拰鍏堣繘鍖荤枟浜у搧銆傚湪涓�涓绉颁负銆婁腑鍥藉埗閫�2025銆嬬殑宸ヤ笟璁″垝涓嬶紝涓浗姝ｅ湪杩欎簺琛屼笟閲屽姹傜潃涓诲鍦颁綅銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n涓浗澶ц繛鐨勪竴瀹堕挗閾佸巶銆傜壒鏈楁櫘鏀垮簻灏嗗鐢靛瓙瑙︽懜灞忋�侀挗閾佹澘銆佸尰鐤椾华鍣ㄣ�侀鏈洪浂閮ㄤ欢銆佺數姹犱互鍙婂叾浠栦腑鍥戒骇鍝佸緛鏀跺叧绋庛��\r\n\r\n\r\n鐗规湕鏅斂搴滆〃绀猴紝鏉ヨ嚜澶氫釜鏀垮簻鏈烘瀯鐨勮锤鏄撳垎鏋愬笀宸茬粡纭畾浜嗗摢浜涗骇鍝佷細鍦ㄨ繖浜涙斂绛栦腑鍙楃泭锛屼絾涔熷娓呭崟杩涜浜嗕慨璁紝绉婚櫎浜嗘湁鍙兘瀵圭編鍥界粡娴庢垨娑堣垂鑰呴�犳垚骞叉壈锛屾垨鍙楁硶寰嬬害鏉熺殑浜у搧銆備骇鍝佹竻鍗曚富瑕侀泦涓簬鏈烘鍜岄珮绉戞妧闆堕儴浠讹紝鍩烘湰鎺掗櫎浜嗗彲鐩存帴鍦ㄥ鍚夌壒(Target)鎴栨矁灏旂帥(Walmart)鍑哄敭鐨勪腑鍥藉埗閫犳秷璐瑰搧鎴愬搧銆傚緛绋庢秹鍙婄編鍥芥瘡骞磋繘鍙ｆ�诲�艰揪500浜跨編鍏冪殑涓浗鍟嗗搧銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n娓呭崟鍏竷鍚庝細鏈変竴涓�氱煡鍜岃瘎璁烘湡锛岀編鍥藉叕鍙稿彲浠ュ湪姝ゆ湡闂村唴灏变骇鍝佺殑閫夋嫨鍚戠壒鏈楁櫘鏀垮簻鎻愬嚭寤鸿銆傚叕鍙搁渶鍦�5鏈�11鏃ュ墠閫掍氦涔﹂潰鎰忚锛屽叕寮�鍚瘉浼氬皢浜�5鏈�15鏃ュ湪鍗庣洓椤夸妇琛屻��\r\n\r\n\r\n铏界劧璁稿缇庡浗鍏徃琛ㄧず浠栦滑鍦ㄤ腑鍥藉彈鍒颁簡涓嶅叕骞冲緟閬囷紝浣嗛潰瀵逛笘鐣屾渶澶т袱涓粡娴庝綋涔嬮棿鍙兘鍙戠敓鐨勮锤鏄撴垬浠ュ強鍙兘浼氬甫鏉ョ殑缁忔祹鍚庢灉锛屼粬浠悗鎮斾簡锛屽紑濮嬪弽瀵圭櫧瀹殑璁″垝銆傚浜庣害缈拌开灏�(John Deere)鍜岃嫻鏋�(Apple)杩欐牱鐨勫叕鍙革紝浠ュ強澶ц眴鍜屽叾浠栧啘浣滅墿鐨勭妞嶈�呮潵璇达紝涓浗渚濈劧涓�涓槸閲嶈涓斿湪涓嶆柇澧為暱鐨勫競鍦恒��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍛ㄤ竴锛屼腑鍥藉缇庡浗浜у搧瀹炴柦浜嗘姤澶嶆�у叧绋庯紝閲戣瀺甯傚満澶у箙涓嬭穼锛屼絾鍛ㄤ簩宸茬粡鏀跺洖浜嗗ぇ閮ㄥ垎澶卞湴銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鐧藉鐬勫噯鐨勮繖浜涗骇鍝佺鍚堝畠甯屾湜鍦ㄤ腑鍥藉崰鎹富瀵肩殑灏栫鎶�鏈鍩熷唴鍙栬儨鐨勮鍒掞紝濡傚崐瀵间綋銆佺數鍔ㄦ苯杞﹀拰鍏堣繘鍖荤枟浜у搧銆傚湪涓�涓绉颁负銆婁腑鍥藉埗閫�2025銆嬬殑宸ヤ笟璁″垝涓嬶紝涓浗姝ｅ湪杩欎簺琛屼笟閲屽姹備富瀵煎湴浣嶃�� \r\n\r\n澶氭鎵胯灏嗗涓浗璐告槗琛屼负閲囧彇寮虹‖琛屽姩鐨勭壒鏈楁櫘鍛ㄤ簩琛ㄧず锛屼粬鏈墦绠楀拰涓浗鍜岀潶鐩稿锛屼絾涓浗涓嶅叕骞崇殑璐告槗琛屼负宸茬粡鎸佺画澶箙銆傗�滆繖涓嶆槸鎴戜滑鍙互蹇嶅彈鐨勶紝鈥濈壒鏈楁櫘鍦ㄧ櫧瀹锛屽苟琛ュ厖閬擄紝鈥滆繖鏄垜鐨勭珵閫夋壙璇恒�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鐗规湕鏅殑椤鹃棶鎵硅瘎杩囧幓鍑犲眾鏀垮簻鍏佽涓浗鍦ㄦ墦鐮翠笘璐哥粍缁�(World Trade Organization)绛夌粍缁囧疄琛岀殑鍥介檯璐告槗瑙勫垯鐨勫悓鏃讹紝浠庡叏鐞冭锤鏄撲腑鍙楁儬鈥斺�斾腑鍥藉杩欓」鎸囨帶浜堜互鍚﹁銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗘斂搴滄鍦ㄥ姫鍔涜鏈嶈繖浜涙壒璇勮�咃紝鐗规湕鏅墍鏀寔鐨勮繖绉嶅己纭锤鏄撴帾鏂藉彲浠ユ敼鍙樹腑鍥界殑琛屼负锛屼篃涓嶄細璁╀笘鐣岄櫡鍏ヨ锤鏄撴垬骞舵渶缁堜激鍙婄編鍥界殑宸ヤ汉鎴栨秷璐硅�呫�傞櫎浜嗗叧绋庯紝鐧藉杩樺噯澶囬檺鍒朵腑鍥藉缇庡浗绉戞妧鍜屽垱鏂扮殑鎶曡祫銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滄斂搴滆嚧鍔涗簬鎭㈠鎴戜滑涓庝腑鍥界殑璐告槗鍏崇郴涓殑鍏钩涓庡叕姝ｏ紝杩欐棤鍙帤闈烇紝鈥濈編鍥藉叏鍥藉晢浼�(U.S. Chamber of Commerce)楂樼骇鍓細闀垮吋鍥介檯浜嬪姟涓荤钖勮繄浼�(Myron Brilliant)璇达紝鈥滀絾鏄紝瀵圭編鍥芥秷璐硅�呭拰宸ヤ綔宀椾綅鍒涢�犺�呮瘡澶╀娇鐢ㄧ殑浜у搧寰佺◣锛屽苟涓嶆槸瀹炵幇杩欎釜鐩爣鐨勬纭�斿緞銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍥介檯鎴樼暐鐮旂┒涓績(Center for Strategic and International Studies)鐨勪腑鍥介棶棰樹笓瀹剁敇鎬濆痉(Scott Kennedy)琛ㄧず锛岀壒鏈楁櫘鏀垮簻鐨勫仛娉曚笌杩囧幓鍑犲眾鏀垮簻鎴劧涓嶅悓锛屽悗鑰呰瘯鍥鹃�氳繃鍗忓晢瀵硅瘽涓庝腑鏂瑰氨璐告槗琛屼负杈炬垚鍗忚銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鐢樻�濆痉琛ㄧず锛岀浉姣斾箣涓嬶紝鐗规湕鏅瀵肩殑鐧藉姝ｈ瘯鍥鹃�氳繃鏁屽褰诲簳閲嶇疆涓ゅ浗鐨勫叧绯汇�傗�滀粬浠妸杩欑湅鎴愪竴鍦烘嚘澶崥寮堛�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏀寔鎬荤粺璐告槗璁▼鐨勭粍缁団�滅箒鑽ｇ編鍥借仈鐩熲��(The Coalition for a Prosperous America)琛ㄧず锛岄拡瀵逛腑鍥界殑琛屽姩鏄粠鈥滃辜绋氣�濊锤鏄撹浆鍙樹负鈥滄垬鐣ユ�р�濊锤鏄撱�傗�滅互闈栨椂浠ｅ繀椤荤粨鏉燂紝鈥濊缁勭粐鐨勫獟浣撲富绠¤憜鎷壜烽┈鏂浖(Paola Masman)璇淬��\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗙壒鏈楁櫘鏀垮簻鐨勮锤鏄撴帾鏂藉鑷磋澶氱編鍥戒紒涓氬涓浗鏀垮簻鍙兘鍋氬嚭鐨勫弽搴旀劅鍒版媴蹇с�備腑鍥藉畼鍛樺凡缁忚〃绀猴紝灏嗚缃锤鏄撳鍨掞紝鍥炲簲缇庡浗鐨勮鍔ㄣ��\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滄垜浠娍蹇呬細浠ュ悓鏍风殑瑙勬ā銆佸悓鏍风殑閲戦鍜屽悓鏍风殑寮哄害杩涜鍥炲嚮锛屸�濅腑鍥介┗缇庡浗澶т娇宕斿ぉ鍑湪鎺ュ彈閲囪鏃惰〃绀恒�傞噰璁垮唴瀹瑰懆涓�鍙戝竷鍦ㄤ腑鍥芥柊闂荤綉绔欎腑鍥界幆鐞冪數瑙嗙綉鍖楃編鍒嗗彴(CGTN America)涓娿�備粬杩樿〃绀猴紝涓浗涓�鐩村湪鍔犲己瀵圭煡璇嗕骇鏉冪殑淇濇姢锛屽噯澶囨牴鎹嚜宸辩殑娉曞緥瀹℃煡鎵�鏈夋浠躲��\r\n\r\n\r\n涓轰簡鍥炲簲缇庡浗鐨勬柊鍏崇◣锛屼腑鍥藉彲鑳戒細澧炲姞浠�涔堝叧绋庯紝浠嶉渶鎷洰浠ュ緟銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍒嗘瀽浜哄＋琛ㄧず锛屼腑鍥芥斂搴滃鍏崇◣鐨勮璁℃剰鍦ㄦ崯瀹虫敮鎸佺壒鏈楁櫘鐨勭編鍥藉湴鍖猴紝浠ュ埡婵�鎬荤粺鐨勬敮鎸佽�呭悜浠栨柦鍘嬶紝杩娇浠栨敼鍙樻斂绛栥�傚竷椴侀噾鏂浼�(Brookings Institution)鐨勯珮绾х爺绌跺憳椹厠路绌嗙綏(Mark Muro)鍦ㄤ竴浠藉垎鏋愭姤鍛婁腑鍙戠幇锛屾按鏋溿�佸潥鏋溿�佺尓鑲夊拰閽㈢绛夎寰佺◣浜у搧鏈夌浉褰撳涓�閮ㄥ垎鏉ヨ嚜鏀寔鐗规湕鏅殑鍘裤��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍐滀笟绀惧尯鏄編鍥芥渶澶х殑鍑哄彛鑰呬箣涓�锛屼篃鏄壒鏈楁櫘鐨勫潥瀹為�夋皯鍩虹锛岃繖涓兢浣撴牸澶栨槗鍙楁墦鍑汇�備腑鍥界殑25%鍏崇◣瀵圭編鍥界尓鑲変緵搴斿晢鐨勬墦鍑讳細鐗瑰埆澶э紝鍘诲勾浠栦滑鍚戜腑鍥藉嚭鍙ｄ簡浠峰�艰秴杩�10浜跨編鍏冪殑浜у搧銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鑹惧ゥ鐡﹀窞鍏卞拰鍏氬弬璁憳绾﹀凹路鍘勬仼鏂壒(Joni Ernst)琛ㄧず锛岀編鍥藉啘姘戝凡缁忔槸鍦ㄥ媺鍔涙敮鎾戙�傗�滃叧绋庡崌楂樺皢浼ゅ鑹惧ゥ鐡﹀窞鐨勭敓浜ц�咃紝鎹熷鍐滄潙缁忔祹锛屸�濆巹鎭╂柉鐗硅锛屸�滄垜甯屾湜鎴戜滑鑳芥帹琛屾彁楂樼珵浜夊姏鐨勬斂绛栵紝鑰屼笉鏄噺灏戞垜浠繘鍏ュ鍥藉競鍦虹殑鏈轰細銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍘勬仼鏂壒涔嬫墍浠ュ彂琛ㄨ繖鏍风殑瑷�璁猴紝鏄洜涓虹壒鏈楁櫘鎬荤粺杩涗竴姝ュ▉鑳侀��鍑恒�婂寳缇庤嚜鐢辫锤鏄撳崗瀹氥��(North American Free Trade Agreement)锛屽苟涓旀淳鍐涢槦鍓嶅線瑗垮崡杈瑰锛屼互鎵撳嚮绌胯秺澧ㄨタ鍝ョ殑闈炴硶绉绘皯銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鐧藉椤鹃棶鏁︿績灏藉揩缁撴潫灏便�婂寳缇庤嚜鐢辫锤鏄撳崗瀹氥�嬪睍寮�鐨勬椃鏃ユ寔涔呯殑璋堝垽锛屽悓鏃剁壒鏈楁櫘缁х画濞佽儊閫�鍑鸿鍗忓畾銆傚懆浜岋紝浠栫О璇ュ崗瀹氣�滃缇庡浗鏉ヨ锛屾槸涓�涓崄鍒嗗彲鎬曡�屼涪鑴哥殑浜ゆ槗鈥濄��\r\n\r\n\r\n娆㈣繋鍦═witter涓婂叧娉ㄦ湰鏂囦綔鑰匒na Swanson: @AnaSwanson銆�\r\n\r\n\r\nNatalie Kitroeff銆丅en Casselman鑷航绾︼紝Keith Bradsher鑷笂娴峰鏈枃鏈夋姤閬撹础鐚��\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氱航绾︽椂鎶ヤ腑鏂囩綉"
