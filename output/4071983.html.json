'Not even a little bit,' Trump said. 'I don't regret it.'\n'Why would I regret it?' he asked amid applause from the audience.\nTrump said there were three scenarios to explain Obama's past: 'Either it's fine, or he was born in Kenya, or in my opinion there's a very good chance he was born here, and said he was born in Kenya. Because if you were born in Kenya, you got into colleges, and you got aid,' Trump said.\nThough many Americans have tired of Trump's quest to see Obama's personal records, Trump claims people on the street are still asking him to pursue the issue.\nSeveral days before the 2012 presidential election, Trump announced that he was offering President Obama $5 million to put toward a charity in his home town, Chicago, Illinois, if he turned over his birth certificate, passport and college records.\nTrump says he later increased that amount to $50 million, a number that was not reported in the media at the time, but Obama still wouldn't play ball.\nUnlike Obama, Trump says he's all facts and no fiction. His hair? Totally real, Trump said on Tuesday. 'They attack my hair. It's mine,' Trump said during his speech while yanking on his head. 'Would anybody like to inspect?'\n'They say you wear the worst hairpiece I've ever seen, what a horrible wig,' he continued, explaining that he's made it clear on Twitter that his hair is real, yet people keep claiming it's fake for some reason he said.\n'You know it's funny, but when people wanna keep going, they keep going,' Trump noted.\nThe billionaire was less forthcoming about whether or not he has any big political plans for 2016.\n'We’re going to see what happens in ‘16,' he said. 'If I don’t see the right person, I will do something in ’16.'\n \n 英国《每日邮报》5月27日报道，美国房地产大亨特朗普质疑总统奥巴马出生地，一再要求后者出示出生证明，此人近期就“出生证门”又抛出另一个理论――奥巴马为了能进入美国大学，谎称自己出生在肯尼亚。\n当天，特朗普在国家记者俱乐部亮相，当被问到是否对过去针对奥巴马出生地发表的一系列言论表示后悔时，特朗普称：“对此，我不感到一丁点儿后悔，我为什么要后悔呢？”他接着说，三种情况可以解释奥巴马的过去：第一，出生在美国，第二，出生在肯尼亚 ，第三，出生在美国，但是为了能进入美国大学，获得资金援助，便谎称出生在肯尼亚。\n特朗普称，尽管很多美国人已经厌倦了他对奥巴马的个人纪录追根究底，但还是依旧有人要求他把事情弄个水落石出。\n2012年总统大选期间，特朗普拿奥巴马出生证明“说事”。他表示，如果奥巴马拿出出生证、所有的大学入学和护照记录，他便立刻给奥巴马家乡芝加哥市的一个慈善机构捐500万美元，随后将数额追加到大约5000万美元。提到此事，川普在记者俱乐部表示从未收到奥巴马的回复。\n参加活动期间，特朗普不忘拿自己的头发开玩笑，他称和奥巴马不同，自己“货真价实”。\n“大家批评我戴假发，但我的头发是真的，有人愿意检查一下吗？”\n“我曾在推特上说的很清楚，头发如假包换，但依旧有人由于某种原因，否认这一事实。如果他们非愿意这样做，请便。”\n另外，特朗普还被问到是否参加2016年总统大选，他仅表示，如果没有看到合适人选参选的话，他会采取一些行动。"
