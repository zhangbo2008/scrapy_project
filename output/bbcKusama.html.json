"Yayoi Kusama is the biggest-selling female artist in the world. And in her bright-red wig and quirky polka-dot ensembles, she is also one of the most instantly recognisable. At almost 90 years old she is still astonishingly prolific. Her upcoming show at the Victoria Miro gallery in London is bound to draw crowds around the block, desperate to be photographed inside her new, fabulously Instagrammable Infinity Room.\nBut before reaching this exalted position Kusama had to endure childhood trauma, and watch as her ideas were brazenly stolen by her male peers, events which led to mental illness and suicide attempts. Her extraordinary story of survival is told in a fascinating new documentary, Kusama: Infinity.\nKusama was born in 1929 in the rural provincial town of Matsumoto, Japan and from a young age was determined to be a painter. Her early works reveal what was to become an enduring fascination with both natural forms and polka dots, the latter allegedly appearing to her in a vision. However, her family were far from supportive. As Heather Lenz, the producer and director of Kusama: Infinity explains, it was simply not the thing for a woman at that time to have career ambitions. “The expectation was that she would get married and have kids – and not just get married but have an arranged marriage,” she tells BBC Culture.\n She sewed dollar bills into her kimono and set off across the Pacific determined to conquer New York \nHer mother snatched drawings from her before she was able to finish them, which may explain her obsessive creative drive as she rushes to finish a work before it can be taken from her. Frustrated at her husband’s infidelity Kusama’s mother would force her daughter to spy on him with his lovers. She found the experience so traumatic that she developed a lifelong aversion to sex.\n \nUnsurprisingly, Kusama began to think of a means of escaping her stifling home environment. A great admirer of Georgia O’Keefe, in whose fantastical, dreamlike depictions of nature she saw a kindred spirit, she took the extraordinarily bold step of writing to her for advice. “I’m only on the first step of the long difficult life of being a painter. Will you kindly show me the way?” she asked.\nShe must have been ecstatic when O’Keefe wrote back, even if it was to warn her that “In this country an artist has a hard time making a living.” All the same, she advised Kusama to come to the US and show her work to anyone who might be interested.\nAt the time Kusama spoke very little English, and it was prohibited to send money from Japan to the US. Undaunted, she sewed dollar bills into her kimono and set off across the Pacific determined to conquer New York and make her name in the world.\nInfinity and beyond\nIt was not to be that easy.  The New York art world was male dominated to the extent that even many of the female dealers didn’t want to exhibit women.\nAlthough Kusama won the praise of Donald Judd, a notable artist and critic, in an early review of her work, and even though the painter Frank Stella was an admirer, real success eluded her. A fact made all the more agonising as she was forced to watch her male peers gain recognition for her ideas.\nClaes Oldenburg was ‘inspired’ by her fabric phallic couch to start creating the soft sculpture for which he would become world famous, while Andy Warhol would copy her innovative idea of creating repeated images of the sole exhibit in her One Thousand Boats installation for his Cow Wallpaper.\nBut worse was to come. In 1965 Kusama created the world’s first mirrored-room environment, a precursor to her Infinity Mirror Rooms, at the Castellane Gallery in New York. As man prepared to head for the moon, Kusama had uniquely grasped the public’s growing awareness of infinity. She confronted them with this unnerving concept through a seemingly endless environment.\nOnly a few months later, in a complete change of artistic direction, avant-garde artist Lucas Samaras exhibited his own mirrored installation at the far more prestigious Pace Gallery.\nDistraught and dejected, Kusama threw herself from the window of her apartment.\n Kusama’s desire to create was always greater than her desire to die \nWith the support of friends such as gallery owner Beatrice Webb, she somehow managed to pull herself together and in a remarkable show of determination took herself to the 1966 Venice Biennale, without invitation, to show her Narcissus Garden.  A witty take on the commercialisation of the art world, it comprised 1500 mirrored balls that she sold off at a few dollars a time – until officials put a stop to it.\n“At this point she’s no longer going to be a slave to the gallery system and have someone decide when and where she’ll show her art,” says Lenz.\nConfronting her demons\nBack in the US, Kusama began staging happenings in newsworthy locations such as Central Park and the grounds of MoMa, often with the intention of promoting peace or criticising the art establishment. But the fact that many of these events involved nudity caused scandal back home in Japan and great shame to her conservative family. Even some elements of the US press criticised what they saw as her endless desire for publicity.\nIncreasingly disillusioned and depressed she returned home to Japan where, without the support of family or friends and finding herself unable to paint, she once again attempted suicide.\nBut it seems that Kusama’s desire to create was always greater than her desire to die. Miraculously, she managed to find a hospital where the doctors were interested in art therapy and checked herself in.\nIn this secure environment she found herself able to make art again. Her first works were an uncharacteristically dark series of collages in which she embraced the imagery of natural life cycles, almost as if she was challenging herself to confront her demons.\nBy this point Kusama had been virtually forgotten both at home and abroad but showing her enduring creative drive and determination she began to re-establish herself from scratch, and gradually her work began to be re-evaluated. A retrospective of her work was held at the Center for International Contemporary Arts in New York in 1989, and four years later, the Japanese art historian, Akira Tatehata, managed to persuade the government that she should be the first solo artist to represent Japan at the 1993 Venice Biennale. \nAlthough a delicate Kusuma had to be accompanied by a psychotherapist, fearful of a nervous breakdown, the exhibition was a phenomenal success and led to a huge transformation in how she was received and recognised in Japan.\nFurther retrospectives followed while increasing recognition and her supportive environment allowed Kusama to continue to transform her trauma into art. However, when Lenz began work on her documentary in 2001 Kusama’s global reputation was still in its infancy. “Ironically I thought the film was going to bring her greater success,” she laughs.\nKusama’s astonishing rise in the intervening years owes much to social media but one hopes that the documentary will encourage people to put down their phones and take time to properly reflect on her work next time they go to see it. Whether viewing pumpkins, polka dots or immersed in one of her awe-inspiring Infinity Rooms, what visitors are looking at is nothing less than the redemptive power of art.\n草间弥生(Yayoi Kusama)是世界上最畅销的女艺术家。她的一袭亮红色假发和风格奇特的波尔卡点式套装，让她成为辨识度最高的艺术家之一。几乎90岁的她仍然多产，这让人难以置信。她即将在伦敦维多利亚米罗美术馆(Victoria Miro gallery)揭幕的展出定会让整个街区人潮涌动，观众们渴望在她崭新炫酷的无限屋(Infinity Room)里留影，并且分享到 Instagram。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    草间弥生的展览 —— 包括她的无限镜屋(Infinity Mirror Room)——吸引了大批观众，而且在Instagram 上广受欢迎。\r\n                \n然而在声名显赫之前，草间弥生不得不忍受童年时期的痛苦，并眼睁睁地看着自己的构思被男性同行肆无忌惮地窃取，这些事情导致她患上了精神疾病，并有了自杀的企图。她非凡的求生之路被写进了一部颇具吸引力的纪录片《草间弥生：无限》。\n1929 年，草间弥生出生于日本松本市(Matsumoto)的郊区。她自小便立志成为一名画家。她的早期作品显示出她对于自然和波尔卡点式的持久迷恋。据称，波尔卡点式出现在了她的幻觉中。然而她的家人完全不支持她的艺术追求。是《草间弥生：无限》的制片人兼导演楞次(Heather Lenz)说，在那个时候追求事业完全不是女性应该做的事情。\"人们希望女性结婚生子——不仅是结婚，而且还是包办婚姻，\"她告诉 BBC 文化栏目组。\n母亲没等她画完就把画夺走了，这也许可以解释她为何有痴迷的创造欲，因为她要赶在别人把作品夺走之前完工。草间弥生的母亲对丈夫的不忠感到沮丧，常常强迫草间弥生去监视父亲和他的情人。这段经历让她痛苦不堪，并令她终身都对性感到厌恶。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    楞次和草间弥生在一起 ，楞次执导了关于这位艺术家的新纪录片。\r\n                \n不出意外，草间弥生开始思考逃离这个让她窒息的家庭环境的方法。草间弥生是欧姬芙 (Georgia O'Keefe)的狂热崇拜者，在欧姬芙充满梦幻色彩的描摹自然的作品中，她看到了一种同类的精神，她迈出了极具勇气的一步——写信给欧姬芙征求她的建议。\"我还仅仅停留在做画家这条艰辛长路的第一步。请问您能告诉我这条路该怎么走下去吗？\"她问道。 \n欧姬芙给她回信时她的心头一定是一阵狂喜，即使这封回信是要提醒她\"在这个国家做艺术家很难谋生。\"同时，她建议草间弥生来美国，把作品展示给任何可能会感兴趣的人。\n那时草间弥生不太会说英文，而且从日本往美国寄钱也被禁止。草间弥生毫无畏惧地把美元钞票缝进和服，向着太平洋彼岸进发了，她决心征服纽约，并在世界上赢得一席之地。\n然而这并非那么容易。纽约的艺术圈由男性主导，即使女经纪人也不愿展出女性的作品。\n尽管卓越的艺术家兼评论家贾德(Donald Judd) 在早期评论中对草间弥生作品赞赏有加，尽管画家斯特拉(Frank Stella)是草间弥生的崇拜者，但她却没有真正获得成功。更痛苦的是，她眼睁睁地看着男性同行窃取自己的构思而获得业界的认可。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    早年的草间弥生被人轻视，看着男性同行窃取自己的构思而成名。\r\n                \n欧登柏格(Claes Oldenburg)从她的织物沙发作品\"《积累No. 1》（Accumulation No. 1）中\"得到灵感\"，开始创作软雕塑，为此扬名世界。沃荷(Andy Warhol)复制了她的创新想法——为《1000条船》(One Thousand Boats)装置艺术中的唯一展品创造重复图像——并将这一想法用到了他的《牛墙纸》(Cow Wallpaper)中。 \n更糟糕的还在后面。1965年，草间弥生在纽约的卡斯特拉讷画廊(Castellane Gallery)创造了世界上首个镜屋环境，即她的无限屋的前身。人类准备登月之时，草间弥生独具慧眼地抓住了公众日益增长的对于\"无限\"的认识。她通过一个看似无限的环境让人们直面这一令人不安的概念。\n<!--\r\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-3135658776052410\";\r\n/* mingshi */\r\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"4998228531\";\r\ngoogle_ad_width = 336;\r\ngoogle_ad_height = 280;\r\n//-->\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n仅仅几个月后，前卫派艺术家萨马拉斯(Lucas Samaras)在更富盛名的佩斯画廊(Pace Gallery)展示了他自己的镜像装置，艺术内涵全然改变。\n忧心沮丧的草间弥生从自家公寓的窗户中纵身跳下。\n在画廊老板韦布(Beatrice Webb) 等朋友们的支持下，她努力振作了起来，展现出坚定的决心。1966年，在没有接到邀请的情况下，草间弥生来到威尼斯国际艺术双年展(Venice Biennale)，展示了她的《那克索斯的花园》(Narcissus Garden)。这一展览是艺术商业化的一次尝试，作品包含了1500个镜球，她每次以几美元的低价卖掉几只——直到主办方叫停。 \n\"这个时候她不用再受制于画廊系统了，也不用再由人来决定何时何地展示自己的艺术作品，\" 楞次说。\n回到美国，草间弥生开始在有新闻热点场所——诸如中央公园(Central Park) 以及现代艺术学博物馆(MoMa)——举行即兴艺术表演，通常是为了倡导和平或者批评艺术体制。然而许多这类活动都涉及裸体，这在她的家乡日本引发了丑闻，并让她的保守家庭蒙羞。甚至美国新闻界的一些报道都批评，人们看到的是她想提升曝光率的无尽欲望。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    作品中频繁出现的裸体引来祖国日本的鄙视，并让草间弥生的家庭蒙羞。\r\n                \n草间弥生的幻想日渐破灭、抑郁与日俱增。她回到日本，没有家人和朋友的支持，自己也无法作画，她准备再次自杀。\n但草间弥生的创作欲似乎总要比死亡欲更强大。她奇迹般地发现了一家医院，这里的医生对艺术治疗很感兴趣，于是她住了进去。 \n在这样一个安全的环境中，她发现自己又可以进行艺术创作了。她的第一批作品是非典型性的暗色拼贴系列，她在作品中融入了自然生命周期的意境，几乎就像她在挑战自我、直面恶魔。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    草间弥生住进了一家热衷艺术治疗的医院——再一次开始重塑生活并进行艺术创作。\r\n                \n到这个时候，草间弥生几乎已经被国内外遗忘了，然而她持久的创造欲和决心使得她从零开始重塑自我，她的作品逐渐开始重新被人们评价。1989 年，她在纽约国际当代艺术中心(Center for International Contemporary Arts)举办了作品回顾展，四年之后，日本的艺术历史学家建 (Akira Tatehata)说服政府，让她成为首位代表日本参加 1993 年威尼斯国际艺术双年展的个人艺术家。\n因为医生担心她出现神经衰弱，脆弱的草间弥生需要由精神治疗医生陪同，不过展览取得了极大成功；在日本，人们对她的接受和认可程度迎来了巨大转变。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    草间弥生的作品逐渐被人们重新评价。她成为当今世界最畅销的女艺术家。\r\n                \n更多的作品回顾展接踵而至，日益增加的认可度以及支持的环境都让草间弥生得以继续将自己的痛苦转化为艺术。然而，当 2001 年楞次开始致力于拍摄关于草间弥生的纪录片时，她的全球知名度仍然还处于初级阶段。\"具有讽刺意味的是，我认为这部电影将带给她更大的成功，\" 楞次笑着说。 \n这些年草间弥生成名鹊起，在很大程度上归功于社交媒体，有人希望这部纪录片能鼓励人们放下手机，并在下次观赏她的作品时花点时间去深思其内涵。不管是观看南瓜、波尔卡点，或是沉浸于她令人惊叹的无限屋，观众看到的是艺术的救赎力量。\n\r\n\r\r\n\nYayoi Kusama is the biggest-selling female artist in the world.
