"Melissa Lehan’s work as a private tutor has taken her to some fantastic places. She worked in Bermuda for a couple of years, then Canada. There were stints in southern France, the Bahamas and Tuscany in Italy. At the moment she’s working in the countryside in Luxembourg, earning a six-figure annual salary.\nAn Oxford graduate and qualified teacher, Lehan, 36, works with children in a home-schooling role. She’s been doing this for 10 years. Her clients are generally wealthy parents who for various reasons aren’t happy with local schools and want a better education for their children.\nShe loves her job, which comes with paid accommodation and travel. But when you ask her why, it’s not the exotic locations or the time she taught on a private yacht that she highlights. Instead she talks about the relationships she develops with her students and having the freedom to drive a curriculum by weaving subjects together in a way that’s directly relevant to her learner.\n“Clicking and helping that one child – knowing them so well that you know what they’re going to learn and what’s going to help them – is what keeps me going,” she says.\n\r\n\n\r\n                   Anthony Fok turned down a huge sum to ensure a student got an A grade a month before an exam. He says performing miracles at the last minute is not possible\r\n                \nA private tuition boom\nGlobally, the private tuition industry is booming. One forecast says it will be worth $227bn by 2022, fuelled by growth in Asia and developments in online tutoring, like firms connecting students with tutors all over the world. The industry is largely unregulated and there are all kinds of providers: freelancers, cram schools, large chains, online services, bespoke agencies and more.\nAt the top end are a small number of highly-paid people for whom the phrase ‘super tutor’ has been bandied about. Around the world it means slightly different things. There’s the full-time private tutor, as exemplified by Lehan, in many cases used by affluent to super-wealthy parents working overseas who want to get their children in to top schools and universities in the US or UK.\nIn East Asia it often refers to an expert in a particular subject who teaches groups – one high-profile example is Hong Kong’s Lam Yat-yan, a Chinese language tutor who famously turned down an $11m job offer from a rival tutoring group in 2015. In the US, where in 2017 more than 3.7 million students took the university admission SAT or ACT tests, it’s a test-prep specialist on an eye-opening hourly rate.\nBut beyond the premium pay packets, what makes a top-end tutor? What kind of skills do they have, why do they do it and how much work have they put in to get where they are?\nPreparation and sacrifice\nIn Lehan’s case, ‘super tutor’ isn’t a term she’s particularly interested in. She says it glamorises a role she feels is not well understood. “Day to day, I’m a teacher,” she says, and a hard-working one.\nMost secondary school teachers specialise in one or two subjects, but Lehan has taught children across the full set of GCSEs, national examinations that British teenagers take at 16. She’s a languages graduate with a love of maths, but early on, mastering the sciences posed a challenge. In her first job, she worked non-stop to make sure she was across the curriculum.\n“For me, chemistry was the one thing where I had to put in a lot of extra work,” she says. “And then you obviously spend time going through all of the past papers, all of the marking schemes, making sure you know the little tricks.”\nPlanning and preparation also take time. “You’re planning to make sure it’s working specifically for your pupil and that means, once you’ve got your plans, reviewing how something goes and then making adjustments, also just making it enjoyable for the individual pupil.”\nFor Anthony Fok, sacrificing time with family and friends is part of the job. He’s a tutor in Singapore, where 70% of parents enrol their children in extra classes. Fok, 35, holds group classes for students preparing for A-Level economics, for entry into local and overseas universities. He works evenings and at weekends, and has been flagged as one of a small but growing group of ‘super tutors’ in the city-state. His business turns over more than SGD$1m ($726,000) per year.\nFok charges students SGD$420 ($305) for four 90-minute lessons, rates which he says are on a par with other tutors or “perhaps at a slight premium”. His classes are full – he’s had parents book three years in advance or offer two years’ payment up front to get a place.\nOnce a parent offered him SGD$20,000 to guarantee her child an A grade a month before the exam. He turned it down. “It is not possible to perform miracles at the last minute,” he says. “The first difficulty is that parents think that money solves all problems. But it’s not true!”\nIn a competitive market, Fok has carved out his niche by honing his expertise. He started tutoring at university, then spent five years as a school teacher before opening his own tuition business in 2012. Today, he’s the author of several books on A-Level economics. He makes sure he keeps up-to-date with previous exam papers as well as the latest exam trends and allows his students to message him with queries at any time.\n‘Don't over-promise and under-deliver’\nIn the huge tuition markets of Hong Kong and South Korea, the “rock star” tutors depend on large numbers of students, moving online or livestreaming lectures to grow their reach. But Fok says he doesn’t want to compromise the quality of his teaching by doing this.\nHe cautions against getting into the industry just for the money, saying those who do tend to fail. “Tutors should be genuinely passionate about teaching and put in your 100% effort in helping your students improve,” says Fok. “Don't over-promise and under-deliver. Hard work, hard work and hard work.”\nMeanwhile, in California, Matthew Larriva earns $600 an hour when he commits to one-to-one coaching for the SAT or ACT tests, standardised exams used by US universities. The Ivy League graduate began tutoring in 2011 and has since opened his own test-preparation agency. Other companies were “generalised”, he felt, and there was space for a high-end option. Now he matches up families with tutors paid at about $250 per hour, writes books, gives presentations and accepts only one or two students himself at a time.\n“What I deliver – and the reason I think they are willing to pay up – is the longevity of results,” he says. Many people only work in the field for a short time, he points out, but if you stay “you start to develop a rhythm that’s really strong”. Experienced tutors can help students pick the right test, timeframe and target score, and adapt their teaching to maximise progress at different ability levels.\nSome people, he says, do the maths and assume he’s grossing over a million dollars a year, but they don’t see the time spent working behind the scenes. “It requires constant prep, travel and marketing to make it into an engagement where you can charge $600 an hour,” he says. “And once you're in the door, it's gruelling work during nights, weekends and holidays trying to play educator to the student, counsellor to the parents and mediator between the family.”\nHe estimates he’s one of about 100 people earning at this level in his field, but mentions individuals being paid at higher rates. As for the ‘super tutor’ concept, Larriva says he doesn’t mind people getting publicity as long as their results are in line with their marketing.\nHis bigger concern, he says, is that there’s no standardised qualification to be a tutor in the US. Lots of people market themselves as test-prep tutors, he says, but sometimes it’s not clear what they are achieving for their students. He’d like it if companies could publish students’ results, giving parents more transparency.\nProfessional standards\nAdam Caller voices somewhat similar sentiments. He’s the founder of London-based Tutors International, which provides full-time tutors (including Melissa Lehan) to wealthy families. He’s currently advertising six-figure salary roles in the US, Bermuda, Luxembourg and Hong Kong.\nRather than focusing on salaries or ‘super tutors’ (a term he thinks plays on parents’ fears), Caller says what matters is the outcome for the student. He hires only qualified teachers (unless the client requests otherwise) and his roles can come with specific requirements – extra languages, music or sports, experience with troubled children or learning difficulties.\nHe believes there should be a professional qualification that formally recognises tutors’ expertise.\n“If there was such a thing as a ‘Chartered Tutor’, whereby their professionalism, their knowledge, their professional development – the normal things that you measure professionals by – was being applied to the tutoring industry, that would be superb,” he says.\nIn Lehan’s case, such a move might lead to a better understanding of what she does for a living. “I think there are a lot of people who don’t realise that I’m not just doing a bit of French tutoring for an hour or so after school, that you can actually do your full set of 11-12 GCSEs with one tutor,” she says.\nFor her it’s the students – the girl dismissed by her school as a “C-grade student” who went on to excel in her GCSEs, for example – who make the job rewarding, rather than the trappings of the role.\nMatthew Larriva agrees. “Yes, the job is glamorous sometimes – having billionaires make coffee runs for you and being invited to family dinner with a congressman – but more engaging than glamour is the privilege: to step into someone’s life in this unique position, get to know a family and have them trust a large portion of their child's future to you.”\n利翰（Melissa Lehan）是一名家庭辅导老师，因为这份工作，她已经去过很多地方：先是在百慕大工作了几年，后来又去了加拿大。法国南部、巴哈马群岛和意大利的托斯卡纳，她也都呆过一段时间。 目前，利翰在卢森堡的乡村工作，年薪高达六位数。\n利翰今年36岁，毕业于牛津大学，十年来一直从事这份工作。雇佣她的家长大多手头宽裕且对当地学校有诸多不满，希望子女能获得更好的教育。\n利翰说，她很喜欢这份能提供住宿、免费旅行的工作。 如果要问为什么喜欢，倒也不是因为能够出游各国、乘坐游艇等等。相反地，她更看中这份工作能与学生建立密切关系，并能够根据学生自身情况，设置交叉学科课程。\n她说： “选择一个孩子，全力去帮助他—— 对这个学生了如指掌，知道他接下来需要学什么，我又该怎么样去上课 —— 这就是我坚持的原因所在。”\n<!--\r\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-3135658776052410\";\r\n/* mingshi */\r\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"4998228531\";\r\ngoogle_ad_width =

据预测，到2022年，这一行业的估值将达2270亿美元，其中大部分归功于亚洲地区的业务增长，以及中介公司提供的全球家教在线授课服务。教学辅导行业缺乏监管，又有各式各样的人来分这块蛋糕：独立个人，培训机构，教育集团，在线网校，还有提供定制课程的中介等等。\n而被人叫做是“金牌教师”的，是站在金字塔顶端的一小部分人，他们的收入往往也是最为顶尖的。在不同国家，人们对于金牌教师的理解略有出入。有像利翰这样的全职家教，大多为富裕乃至超级富豪家庭服务。父母在海外事业有成，希望孩子能够前往英美的顶级名校求学。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    首尔曹溪寺内，一位母亲正为自己参加大学修业能力考试（韩国大学入学考试）的孩子祈祷。\r\n                \n东亚地区的名师则通常是开班授课，且专攻于一个学科。香港教语文的林溢欣老师就是一个著名的例子。2015年，有机构出1100万美元想挖走他，但他不为所动。2017年，美国年有超过370万学生为了申请大学参加SAT/ACT考试。即使在美国，林也可以称得上是一个考试培训专家了，他的时薪也足以让人大开眼界。\n撇开工资待遇不说，怎样才能成就一位顶级名师呢？要成为一个这样的老师，需要具备怎样的技能、要如何教课，又需要付出多少的努力呢？\n利翰并不喜欢“金牌名师”这个说法。她觉得是人们不了解，过分美化了这份工作。  她说：“我每天都在教课。”她确实在勤奋地教课。\n多数中学教师只需要教授一两个课程，但利翰教过GCSE的全套课程。（GCSE是英国中学的课程体系之一，16岁时学生需参加国家统一的课程考试。）利翰毕业于语言专业，平时也热爱数学。不久之前，她尝试攻克科学学科，但进展并不很顺利。第一次做家教时，为确保能够进行跨学科授课，利翰努力地学习新知识，一刻也不敢停。\n 她说：“在化学这个科目上，我必须得多下点功夫。要花很多时间去看以前的试卷，去了解评分标准。还有解题的技巧，也是得掌握的。”\n规划课程和备课也同样需要大量的时间。她说：“课程内容一定得让学生能听得进去。在有了大概的授课计划后，要检查、修改、微调，最后还得让学生上得开心。”\n霍东灵认为，牺牲原本属于家人和朋友的时间也是工作的一部分。霍东灵是新加坡的辅导教师，当地70％的家长会为孩子报课外辅导班。 他今年已经35岁了，目前正在教A-level经济学，补习这门课的学生大多是为了申请本地和海外的大学。他的工作时间集中在每天晚上和双休日。霍东灵每年的业绩超过100万新元（约726,000美元），目前已经跻身新加坡的超级辅导教师之列。新加坡的这个群体并不大，但也在增长。霍东灵90分钟授课收费420新元（约305美元）。他说，相比其他老师，他的收费“可能小贵一些”。 他的课程经常爆满 。为了抢到一个名额，有的父母提前三年就开始预约了，甚至还有人愿意一笔预付两年学费。\n曾经有一个家长，希望霍东灵能够在一个月之内把孩子的成绩提升到A，他拒绝了，说：“临时抱佛脚是不会有奇迹降临的。父母觉得金钱可以解决所有问题，但事实并非如此！”\n霍东灵凭着过硬的执教水平，在竞争激烈的市场中获得了一席之地。 他先是在大学里上辅导课，后来当了五年的学校老师，于2012年成立了自己的辅导机构。如今，霍东灵已经出版了数本A-level经济学辅导书。为了确保能及时了解考试题型和命题趋势，他还鼓励学生随时与他联系，向他提问。\n“\n少些许诺，多点实干\n”\n韩国和香港的课外辅导产业链巨大，明星老师的产生得利于庞大的学生群体。为了获得更广的生源，这些老师会进行线上授课、有时还开直播做讲座。但霍东灵说他不会这么做，因为线上授课会降低授课质量。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    英国威尔士一个学校的大厅里排满了空课桌。为参加GCSE的学生们布置好了考场。\r\n                \n霍东灵说，为了赚钱而投身这个行业的人，是注定达不到目的的。他说：“一个合格的老师，应该热爱教育，能够诚心诚意地地帮学生提高成绩。老师应该要少说些大话，多做点事实。 全心全意，勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业。”\n美国加州的拉里瓦（Matthew Larriva）目前一对一辅导学生的SAT/ACT考试（SAT和ACT是美国大学的标准化入学考试），时薪为每小时600美元。拉里瓦藤校毕业，2011年进军教育辅导行业，成立了自己的考试辅导机构。他认为，有的公司倾向于把学生“一刀切”；对于资质好的学生，机构应该给予更好的培训。 因此在他的机构里，老师会和学生家庭进行匹配，时薪大概在250美元上下。进行匹配工作之余，他也会出书、做报告展示、辅导学生，只是一次仅开放两个名额。 \n拉里瓦说：“我们提供的教育能够给学生带来一个长远的影响，这也就是家长为什么愿意掏腰包的原因。”他指出，很多教师刚接触这个行业不久，但只要坚持下去，就会发现越来越得心应手了。 经验老到的教师可以帮助学生匹配考试难度、安排时间计划、设置目标分数；根据不同学生的学习能力，会调整教学方法，以便让在最短时间内让不同程度的学生取得最大进步。\n有好事者计算过他的年收入，结论是超过了一百万美元。但他们没有看到在台下付出的汗水。他说：“让家长为600美元的时薪买单，我无时无刻不在准备，时常出差，更要进行市场营销。一旦进了这个行业的门，即使在晚上、周末、假期时间，也得随时待命，辛苦极了。不论是否在工作时间，都得教育学生，抚平家长情绪，甚至调和家庭矛盾。”\n据他估计，能达到他薪资的辅导老师大概还有100人，也还有人的薪资高于他的水平。拉里瓦认为，推广“金牌教师”的概念没有什么问题，只要能力属实，不做虚假宣传。\n他的担忧反而是美国对辅导老师没有统一的标准。 他说，很多人标榜自己为备考辅导老师，但部分人甚至不知道他们能为学生做些什么。 他希望机构能够公开学生成绩，也能够更便于家长了解。\n卡勒（Adam Caller）是国际教育集团（Tutors International）的创始人，也表达了类似的想法。国际教育集团总部位于伦敦，致力于为富裕家庭提供全职家庭教师（利翰就是其中之一）。 目前，卡勒在美国，百慕大，卢森堡以及香港推广收入过十万的“金牌教师”概念。\n卡勒说，最好的宣传不是教师薪资水平，也不是“金牌教师”的概念（他说这个概念是在利用家长的恐惧心理），学生的成绩才是最好的名片。除非客户要求，他只选合格的教师，附加要求就比较具体了——可能要掌握一门外语，也可能是要有音乐、体育方面的特长，甚至需要有教育问题儿童和学习障碍孩子的经验。\n在他看来，必须有一个行业标准，来判断辅导老师是否达到了专业水准。\n他说：“我希望能有一个注册资格评估，来考察辅导老师的业务水平、知识储备和专业发展等等一系列能够衡量从业人员程度是否够格的东西。”\n对于利翰来说，能建立起这样的资格评估机制，有助于人们理解她究竟在做点什么。她说: “很多人以为我就是在学生下课后辅导一小时法语，完全不知道我这一个老师就能教11到12年级整套的GCSE课程。”\n有一个在学校拿C的女生，从中学退学之后跟着利翰学了一段时间GCSE课程，成果喜人。利翰说，这份工作中最让人欣慰的是看到学生的进步。\n拉里瓦的观点也是如此。他说：“确实是这样的。有时候亿万富翁成了跑腿小弟，有时候国会议员会邀请你共进晚餐 ，这份工作有时特别刺激。但比刺激更能吸引我的是一种荣幸感：能够以这样一个身份进入学生的生活，结识家庭成员，让他们把孩子的未来托付给你。”\n\r\n \nMelissa Lehan’s work as a private tutor has taken her to some fantastic places.

 她说：“我每天都在教课。”她确实在勤奋地教课。\n多数中学教师只需要教授一两个课程，但利翰教过GCSE的全套课程。（GCSE是英国中学的课程体系之一，16岁时学生需参加国家统一的课程考试。）利翰毕业于语言专业，平时也热爱数学。不久之前，她尝试攻克科学学科，但进展并不很顺利。第一次做家教时，为确保能够进行跨学科授课，利翰努力地学习新知识，一刻也不敢停。\n 她说：“在化学这个科目上，我必须得多下点功夫。要花很多时间去看以前的试卷，去了解评分标准。还有解题的技巧，也是得掌握的。”\n规划课程和备课也同样需要大量的时间。她说：“课程内容一定得让学生能听得进去。在有了大概的授课计划后，要检查、修改、微调，最后还得让学生上得开心。”\n霍东灵认为，牺牲原本属于家人和朋友的时间也是工作的一部分。霍东灵是新加坡的辅导教师，当地70％的家长会为孩子报课外辅导班。 他今年已经35岁了，目前正在教A-level经济学，补习这门课的学生大多是为了申请本地和海外的大学。他的工作时间集中在每天晚上和双休日。霍东灵每年的业绩超过100万新元（约726,000美元），目前已经跻身新加坡的超级辅导教师之列。新加坡的这个群体并不大，但也在增长。霍东灵90分钟授课收费420新元（约305美元）。他说，相比其他老师，他的收费“可能小贵一些”。 他的课程经常爆满 。为了抢到一个名额，有的父母提前三年就开始预约了，甚至还有人愿意一笔预付两年学费。\n曾经有一个家长，希望霍东灵能够在一个月之内把孩子的成绩提升到A，他拒绝了，说：“临时抱佛脚是不会有奇迹降临的。父母觉得金钱可以解决所有问题，但事实并非如此！”\n霍东灵凭着过硬的执教水平，在竞争激烈的市场中获得了一席之地。 他先是在大学里上辅导课，后来当了五年的学校老师，于2012年成立了自己的辅导机构。如今，霍东灵已经出版了数本A-level经济学辅导书。为了确保能及时了解考试题型和命题趋势，他还鼓励学生随时与他联系，向他提问。\n“\n少些许诺，多点实干\n”\n韩国和香港的课外辅导产业链巨大，明星老师的产生得利于庞大的学生群体。为了获得更广的生源，这些老师会进行线上授课、有时还开直播做讲座。但霍东灵说他不会这么做，因为线上授课会降低授课质量。\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n                    英国威尔士一个学校的大厅里排满了空课桌。为参加GCSE的学生们布置好了考场。\r\n                \n\r\n\n霍东灵说，为了赚钱而投身这个行业的人，是注定达不到目的的。他说：“一个合格的老师，应该热爱教育，能够诚心诚意地地帮学生提高成绩。老师应该要少说些大话，多做点事实。 全心全意，勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业。”\n美国加州的拉里瓦（Matthew Larriva）目前一对一辅导学生的SAT/ACT考试（SAT和ACT是美国大学的标准化入学考试），时薪为每小时600美元。拉里瓦藤校毕业，2011年进军教育辅导行业，成立了自己的考试辅导机构。他认为，有的公司倾向于把学生“一刀切”；对于资质好的学生，机构应该给予更好的培训。 因此在他的机构里，老师会和学生家庭进行匹配，时薪大概在250美元上下。进行匹配工作之余，他也会出书、做报告展示、辅导学生，只是一次仅开放两个名额。 \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\r\n\n拉里瓦说：“我们提供的教育能够给学生带来一个长远的影响，这也就是家长为什么愿意掏腰包的原因。”他指出，很多教师刚接触这个行业不久，但只要坚持下去，就会发现越来越得心应手了。 经验老到的教师可以帮助学生匹配考试难度、安排时间计划、设置目标分数；根据不同学生的学习能力，会调整教学方法，以便让在最短时间内让不同程度的学生取得最大进步。\n有好事者计算过他的年收入，结论是超过了一百万美元。但他们没有看到在台下付出的汗水。他说：“让家长为600美元的时薪买单，我无时无刻不在准备，时常出差，更要进行市场营销。一旦进了这个行业的门，即使在晚上、周末、假期时间，也得随时待命，辛苦极了。不论是否在工作时间，都得教育学生，抚平家长情绪，甚至调和家庭矛盾。”\n据他估计，能达到他薪资的辅导老师大概还有100人，也还有人的薪资高于他的水平。拉里瓦认为，推广“金牌教师”的概念没有什么问题，只要能力属实，不做虚假宣传。\n他的担忧反而是美国对辅导老师没有统一的标准。 他说，很多人标榜自己为备考辅导老师，但部分人甚至不知道他们能为学生做些什么。 他希望机构能够公开学生成绩，也能够更便于家长了解。\n行业标准\n卡勒（Adam Caller）是国际教育集团（Tutors International）的创始人，也表达了类似的想法。国际教育集团总部位于伦敦，致力于为富裕家庭提供全职家庭教师（利翰就是其中之一）。 目前，卡勒在美国，百慕大，卢森堡以及香港推广收入过十万的“金牌教师”概念。\n卡勒说，最好的宣传不是教师薪资水平，也不是“金牌教师”的概念（他说这个概念是在利用家长的恐惧心理），学生的成绩才是最好的名片。除非客户要求，他只选合格的教师，附加要求就比较具体了——可能要掌握一门外语，也可能是要有音乐、体育方面的特长，甚至需要有教育问题儿童和学习障碍孩子的经验。\n在他看来，必须有一个行业标准，来判断辅导老师是否达到了专业水准。\n他说：“我希望能有一个注册资格评估，来考察辅导老师的业务水平、知识储备和专业发展等等一系列能够衡量从业人员程度是否够格的东西。”\n对于利翰来说，能建立起这样的资格评估机制，有助于人们理解她究竟在做点什么。她说: “很多人以为我就是在学生下课后辅导一小时法语，完全不知道我这一个老师就能教11到12年级整套的GCSE课程。”\n有一个在学校拿C的女生，从中学退学之后跟着利翰学了一段时间GCSE课程，成果喜人。利翰说，这份工作中最让人欣慰的是看到学生的进步。\n拉里瓦的观点也是如此。他说：“确实是这样的。有时候亿万富翁成了跑腿小弟，有时候国会议员会邀请你共进晚餐 ，这份工作有时特别刺激。但比刺激更能吸引我的是一种荣幸感：能够以这样一个身份进入学生的生活，结识家庭成员，让他们把孩子的未来托付给你。”\n\r\n"
