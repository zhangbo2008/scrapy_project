While it鈥檚 impossible to know if human brains respond in precisely the same way to fat and physical activity, the findings offer one more reason to get out and exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt鈥檚 been known for some time that obesity can alter cognition in animals. Past experiments with lab rodents, for instance, have shown that obese animals display poor memory and learning skills compared to their normal-weight peers. They don鈥檛 recognize familiar objects or recall the location of the exit in mazes that they鈥檝e negotiated multiple times.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut scientists hadn鈥檛 understood how excess weight affects the brain. Fat cells, they knew, manufacture and release substances into the bloodstream that flow to other parts of the body, including the heart and muscles. There, these substances jump-start biochemical processes that produce severe inflammation and other conditions that can lead to poor health.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thought the brain, though, should be insulated from those harmful effects. It contains no fat cells and sits behind the protective blood-brain barrier that usually blocks the entry of undesirable molecules.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, recent disquieting studies in animals indicate that obesity weakens that barrier, leaving it leaky and permeable. In obese animals, substances released by fat cells can ooze past the barrier and into the brain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consequences of that seepage became the subject of new neurological experiments conducted by researchers at Georgia Regents University in Augusta and published last month in The Journal of Neuroscience. For the studies, the scientists gathered mice bred to overeat and grow obese, which, after a few weeks of sitting quietly in their cages and eating at will, the animals had obligingly accomplished. As they grew rotund and accumulated more fat cells, the researchers found, their blood showed increasingly hefty doses of a substance called interleukin 1 that is created by fat cells and known to cause inflammation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these mice, as interleukin 1 migrated to the head, it passed the blood-brain barrier and entered areas such as the hippocampus, a part of the brain critical for learning and memory. There, it essentially gummed up the works, the researchers found when they examined tissue from the animals鈥� brains, which had high levels of interleukin 1 together with widespread markers of inflammation. While inflammation can represent a healthy response to invading molecules, it hurts cells if it persists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe researchers also noted extremely low levels in these mice brains of a biochemical associated with healthy synapse function. Synapses are the structures that connect one neuron to another and shunt messages between them. Healthy synapses respond to demands on the brain by slowing or speeding messages, keeping the brain鈥檚 nervous-system traffic manageable. But low levels of the marker of synapse health suggested to the researchers that in these obese animals鈥� inflamed brains, synapses were no longer functioning properly and messages between neurons likely jerked, hiccuped or stalled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat possibility was borne out by subsequent tests on the memory and thinking of some of the remaining obese mice. They performed miserably.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut whether excessive fat cells alone were the underlying cause of the changes in the animals鈥� brains was not clear. Other physiological factors 鈥渃ould have been contributing,鈥� said Alexis Stranahan, a professor at the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Regents, who oversaw the study. So, to isolate the impact of the fat, the researchers simply removed most of it, surgically excising the large bands of fat that each mouse bore around its middle.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter recovery, these slenderized mice showed almost no interleukin 1 in their bloodstreams and, Algernon-like, soon were acing cognitive tests that had stumped them before surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConversely, when the scientists implanted the preserved fat pads into previously lean mice 鈥� and haven鈥檛 we all had nightmares about something like that happening to us in our sleep? 鈥� the animals almost immediately grew dimmer, performing far worse than previously on cognitive tests, although nothing else in their lives had changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results convincingly implicated fat cells as the primary cause of the mice鈥檚 cognitive decline.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut while provocative, the findings had little practical value for people, the scientists realized, since even the most extensive liposuction procedure in humans would remove far less fat than had been excised from the obese mice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the scientists turned, as a less-invasive alternative, to exercise. Gathering more of the obesity-prone mice, they allowed all of them to grow heavy, but then started half on a daily 45-minute program of treadmill running, with encouragement provided by small puffs of air if they began to flag. The other mice remained sedentary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 12 weeks, the running mice still weighed about the same as the unexercised animals. But they had lost significant amounts of fat from around their middles, while adding lean muscle. More telling, they did much better on cognitive tests than the sedentary mice and, when the researchers examined tissue from their hippocampi, showed little evidence of inflammation and robust levels of the chemical marker of synaptic health. The results suggested that, as the scientists write in the study, 鈥渢readmill training normalized hippocampal function,鈥� even in animals born to be fat and that remained heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, these studies were conducted in mice, not people, whose brains may respond very differently. But the possibility that humans, too, may respond in similar ways is tantalizing, Dr. Stranahan said, and the takeaway from her study worth repeating. 鈥淕et out and move,鈥� she said, even 鈥� and especially 鈥� if you carry extra weight. Talk with your doctor about a safe and tolerable exercise program, and then try to stick with that routine so that extra pounds won鈥檛 weigh too heavily on your mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圙RETCHEN REYNOLDS锛�\r\nObesity may have harmful effects on the brain, and exercise may counteract many of those negative effects, according to sophisticated new neurological experiments with mice, even when the animals do not lose much weight.

But they had lost significant amounts of fat from around their middles, while adding lean muscle. More telling, they did much better on cognitive tests than the sedentary mice and, when the researchers examined tissue from their hippocampi, showed little evidence of inflammation and robust levels of the chemical marker of synaptic health. The results suggested that, as the scientists write in the study, 鈥渢readmill training normalized hippocampal function,鈥� even in animals born to be fat and that remained heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n12鍛ㄥ悗锛屾瘡澶╄窇姝ョ殑灏忛紶浣撻噸渚濇棫涓庝粠鏈繍鍔ㄧ殑灏忛紶宸笉澶氥�備絾浠栦滑韬綋涓鐨勮剛鑲噺宸茬粡鏄捐憲鍑忓皯锛岃倢鑲夐噺鍗翠笉鏂鍔犮�傛洿鏈夎鏈嶅姏鐨勬槸锛屽畠浠湪璁ょ煡娴嬭瘯涓殑鎴愮哗杩滆繙浼樹簬涔呭潗涓嶅姩鐨勫皬榧犮�傛澶栵紝鍦ㄧ爺绌朵汉鍛樻鏌ュ畠浠殑娴烽┈缁勭粐鏃讹紝涔熷嚑涔庢病鏈夌湅鍒颁换浣曞彲琛ㄦ槑鐐庣棁瀛樺湪鐨勮瘉鎹紝鍙嶄箣锛岃〃寰佺獊瑙﹀仴搴风殑鍖栧鏍囧織鐗╁垯鍗佸垎鍏呰冻銆傛濡傜瀛﹀浠湪鐮旂┒璁烘枃涓墍鍐欑殑锛岃繖浜涚爺绌剁粨鏋滆〃鏄庯紝鈥滆窇姝ユ満璁粌浣挎捣椹殑鍔熻兘鍙樺緱姝ｅ父鈥濓紝鍗充娇鍦ㄩ偅浜涘ぉ鐢熷鏄撳彂鑳栦笖浠嶇劧浣撻噸瓒呴噸鐨勫姩鐗╀腑渚濈劧濡傛銆�\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, these studies were conducted in mice, not people, whose brains may respond very differently. But the possibility that humans, too, may respond in similar ways is tantalizing, Dr. Stranahan said, and the takeaway from her study worth repeating. 鈥淕et out and move,鈥� she said, even 鈥� and especially 鈥� if you carry extra weight. Talk with your doctor about a safe and tolerable exercise program, and then try to stick with that routine so that extra pounds won鈥檛 weigh too heavily on your mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n褰撶劧锛岃繖浜涚爺绌堕兘鏄湪灏忛紶涓繘琛岀殑锛屼汉绫荤殑澶ц剳寰堝彲鑳戒互杩ュ紓鐨勬柟寮忔潵浣滃簲绛斻�備絾鎴戜滑涔熸棤娉曟帓闄よ繖涓�璇变汉鐨勫彲鑳芥�э細璇翠笉瀹氫汉绫诲ぇ鑴戜細涓庝箣绫讳技鍛紵鏂壒鎷夌撼姹夊崥澹寚鍑猴紝濂硅繖椤圭爺绌剁殑缁撹闈炲父鍊煎緱鍊熼壌銆傗�滆蛋鍑洪棬鍘诲仛杩愬姩鍚э紝鈥濆ス璇达紝濡傛灉浣犺叞涓婂凡缁忓甫浜嗕釜鈥滄晳鐢熷湀鈥濆氨灏ゅ叾闇�瑕佽刀蹇鍔ㄣ�傝窡浣犵殑鍖荤敓璋堣皥锛屽埗瀹氫竴涓畨鍏ㄣ�佸彲浠ユ壙鍙楃殑閿荤偧璁″垝锛岀劧鍚庡皾璇曠収鐫�瀹冨潥鎸佷笅鍘伙紝璁╄秴閲嶇殑浣撻噸涓嶅啀閭ｄ箞璁╀綘浼よ剳绛嬨��\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氫换鎵舵憞\r\n"
