King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.”\r\n\n“我的决定绝不是基于此，”特朗普坚称，“这是一起不可接受的、可怕的罪行。沙特国王萨勒曼(Salman)和王储默罕默德·本·萨勒曼坚决否认对策划或执行谋杀卡舒吉的行动有任何了解。”\r\n\nPunishing Saudi Arabia, he said, would put at risk $110 billion in military sales to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and other military contractors, as well as $340 billion in other investments, which the Saudis had agreed to make since he became president.\r\n\n他说，惩罚沙特阿拉伯会给波音、洛克希德·马丁(Lockheed Martin)、雷神(Raytheon)和其他军事承包商带来1100亿美元的军售风险，还会波及自他就任总统以来，沙特同意进行的3400亿美元的其他投资。\r\n\nEconomists and military analysts said those numbers were so exaggerated as to be fanciful.\r\n\n经济学家和军事分析人士表示，这些数字过于夸张，简直是异想天开。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\n“The world is a very dangerous place!” Mr. Trump began, before seguing into a critique of Iran’s malign behavior in the Middle East, blaming it for killing Americans, sponsoring terrorist organizations, and conducting a “bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen.”\r\n\n“世界是一个非常危险的地方！”特朗普在声明一开始说道，然后他开始批评伊朗在中东的恶行，指责它杀害美国人，资助恐怖组织，以及在也门发动“针对沙特阿拉伯的血腥代理人战争”。\r\n\nAs if to illustrate the president’s point, the Treasury Department on Tuesday morning announced sanctions against nine targets in what officials said was an elaborate Iranian-Russian plot to sell oil to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and use the proceeds to finance Iranian-backed militant groups, like Hamas and Hezbollah.\r\n\n似乎为了说明总统的观点，财政部周二上午宣布，对九个目标实施制裁。官员们表示，这是一个精心谋划的伊朗—俄罗斯阴谋，通过向叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德(Bashar al-Assad)的政权出售石油，然后将收益用于援助伊朗支持的激进组织，如哈马斯(Hamas)和真主党(Hezbollah)。\r\n\nMr. Trump left open the possibility that Prince Mohammed was aware of Mr. Khashoggi’s killing — essentially suggesting that the prince had lied to him in multiple phone conversations.\r\n\n特朗普没有排除王储默罕默德知道卡舒吉被杀的可能性——这实际上表明，这位王储在多次电话中对他撒谎。\r\n\nIn private exchanges with aides, Mr. Trump has rolled his eyes when asked whether he believes the prince could not have been aware of the complex operation to kill Mr. Khashoggi, which involved multiple teams of operatives — some of whom had close ties to the prince — flying to Turkey on private jets and turning a diplomatic facility into a slaughterhouse.\r\n\n与助手私下交流时，当被问及他是否相信王储真有可能不了解这个复杂行动时——涉及多个特工团队，其中一些特工与王储紧密联系，他们搭乘私人飞机前往土耳其，将一处外交场所变成了屠宰场——特朗普翻了个白眼。\r\n"
