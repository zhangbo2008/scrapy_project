But some employees complain that it rarely leads to lasting change.\r\n\n这种反复交流的基础是一种信念，即真理会从不受管制的思想交流中涌现出来。但是一些员工抱怨它很少能带来持久的变化。\r\n\n“As far as mechanisms for expressing feelings, there are plenty of them,” said Meredith Whittaker, a 12-year Google veteran who oversees a research group at the company and helped organize the walkout. “But as far as opportunities for agency and power — for real power over decision-making — some of what you’re seeing is a recognition that the former doesn’t equal the latter.”\r\n\n“说到表达情感的机制，这里有很多，”梅雷迪斯·韦特克(Meredith Whittaker)说，她是一位12年的谷歌资深员工，负责监督公司的一个研究小组，是这次罢工的组织者之一。“但就代理和权力——在决策上的真正权力——的机会而言，你看到的一些事情在告诉你，两者是不平等的。”\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nWhen The New York Times reported in late October that Google had given a high-ranking official a $90 million payout as he left the company after allegations of sexual harassment, organizers said, it ignited these simmering frustrations.\r\n\n《纽约时报》于10月底报道称，谷歌在一名高管因性骚扰指控离开公司时，给了他一笔9000万美元的赔付金，组织者说，这点燃了人们心中酝酿的失望情绪。\r\n\nThe question is how far this sense of individual powerlessness has spread within Google. The walkout organizers argue that the feeling is quite widespread — extending from software developers to hardware engineers and from employees to contractors.\r\n\n问题是这种个人的无力感能在谷歌中传播多远。罢工组织者认为这种感觉非常普遍——从软件开发人员到硬件工程师，从员工到承包商。\r\n\nSome observers agree. Michelle Miller, co-founder of CoWorker.org, which educates workers in tech and other industries on how to assert their labor rights, said that employees at Google “had to start thinking of themselves as some kind of collective” last year after a memo by an employee asserted that women tend to be innately less capable of certain technical work.\r\n\n一些观察者同意这一点。对科技和其他行业员工进行维护劳工权益教育的网站CoWorker.org的联合创始人米歇尔·米勒(Michelle Miller)表示，在去年一名员工发布备忘录声称女性天生就缺乏某些技术工作的能力后，谷歌员工就“不得不开始将自己视为某种集体”。\r\n\nShe said workers who criticized the memo and defended diversity efforts on internal forums were threatened by people sympathetic to the memo’s author, James Damore, and had to band together to defend one another.\r\n\n她说那些批评这份备忘录并在内部论坛上为多元化努力辩护的工作人员，受到了那些同情备忘录作者詹姆斯·达莫尔(James Damore)的人的威胁，并且不得不联合起来互相争辩。\r\n\nSince Damore’s ouster, Google workers have steadily received evidence that management will only heed collective action, Michelle Miller argued. That includes an ad hoc worker revolt that preceded the end of the company’s controversial Pentagon contract.\r\n\n米歇尔·米勒认为，自达莫尔被开除后，谷歌员工已经确信管理层只会留意集体行动。这包括在该公司有争议的五角大楼合同结束之前发生的临时工人抗议。\r\n\nGoogle may have been uniquely vulnerable to a worker uprising given its ostensibly progressive values, including the company’s longtime exhortation, “Don’t be evil,” and the openness of its corporate systems. Organizers note that they executed the entire walkout using Google’s internal platforms and other company resources.\r\n\n考虑到其表面上的进步价值观，包括该公司一直以来秉守的“不作恶”箴言，以及公司系统的开放性，谷歌可能特别容易受到员工反抗的影响。组织者提到他们使用谷歌内部平台和其他公司资源实行了整个罢工。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nThey say they’re confident that the protests will only escalate if the chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and his team don’t put forth a plan to act on some of their demands, among them a worker representative on the board of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and an end to employment contracts that prevent class-action lawsuits and require individual arbitration for discrimination and harassment cases.\r\n\n他们表示，如果首席执行官桑达尔·皮查伊(Sundar Pichai)和他的团队没有给出计划对他们的一些诉求采取行动，他们相信抗议只会升级。这些诉求包括在谷歌母公司Alphabet董事会中设置一名员工代表，以及终止那些阻止集体诉讼并要求对歧视和骚扰案件进行个人仲裁的雇佣合同。\r\n\n“Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,” Pichai said in a statement. “We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.”\r\n\n“员工已就如何改进我们的政策和未来的进程提出了建设性意见，”皮查伊在一份声明中说。“我们正在吸纳他们的所有反馈，以便我们能够将这些想法变为行动。”\r\n\nLabor experts said any changes precipitated by the walkout could spread through Silicon Valley.\r\n\n劳工专家表示，罢工引发的任何变化都可能在硅谷蔓延。\r\n\n\r\n\r\n梅雷迪斯·韦特克(Meredith Whittaker)（图中使用扩音器者）参与了上周谷歌罢工的组织工作。她说，公司为员工提供了很多表达意见的方法，但员工对公司决策的影响力太小。\n\r\n“These companies are competing for employees,” said Matthew Bodie, a law professor at St. Louis University who is a former lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board.\r\n\n“这些公司正在为员工竞争，”圣路易斯大学(St. Louis University)法学教授马修·博迪(Matthew Bodie)说，他是全国劳动关系委员会(National Labor Relations Board)的前律师。\r\n\n“If employees at Facebook are looking at this and saying ‘Wow, that was impressive,'” Bodie said, then Facebook may have to follow suit.\r\n\n“如果Facebook的员工正在关注这件事，并说‘哇，这真是令人钦佩’，”博迪说，那么Facebook可能不得不效仿。\r\n\n\r\n翻译：Shuhua、晋其角\r\n"
