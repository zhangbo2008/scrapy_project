They are still under investigation and could face criminal penalties.\r\n\n政府还禁止该公司董事长高俊芳及其他14名高管从事疫苗行业的经营活动。他们仍在接受调查，可能会面临刑事处罚。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nChinese officials said late Tuesday that they had levied the fine against Changchun Changsheng, which is based in the northeastern Chinese province of Jilin and whose shares trade in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. The penalty disclosed on Tuesday related specifically to the fabrication of data related to a rabies vaccine. The government did not disclose the number of doses or the number of people affected.\r\n\n中国官员周二晚间表示，他们已经对长春长生征收了这笔罚金。长春长生位于中国东北吉林省，其股票在中国南方城市深圳交易。周二公布的罚款明确与一种狂犬疫苗的数据造假有关。政府没有透露受到影响的疫苗数量及人数。\r\n\nBut the company’s vaccine scandal was much broader than rabies. Government investigators said in August that the company had also produced nearly 500,000 substandard doses of a vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.\r\n\n但该公司的疫苗丑闻比狂犬疫苗要大得多。政府的调查于8月表明，该公司还生产了近50万支不符合标准的白喉、破伤风和百日咳疫苗。\r\n\nAccording to the government, Changchun Changsheng used expired vaccine materials, changed production batch numbers, and destroyed and fabricated production records. The company also destroyed a computer hard disk to cover up its illegal acts.\r\n\n政府表示，长春长生使用过期疫苗原料、更改生产批号，还销毁并伪造生产记录。为了掩盖其违法行为，该公司还销毁了一个计算机硬盘。\r\n\nUnlike previous vaccine scandals, the incident involving Changchun Changsheng angered many nationwide because it involved hundreds of thousands of faulty vaccines that are mostly given to babies, in a country where many couples have only one child.\r\n\n与此前的疫苗丑闻不同，这起涉及长春长生的事件在全国各地引发公愤，原因是主要接种涉事数十万支问题的是婴儿，而这个国家许多夫妻只有一个孩子。\r\n\r\n\n\r\n位于吉林省的长春长生生物科技公司股票于8月底停牌。\n\r\nThe state-run news agency Xinhua called the penalty “top-level punishment” and “the most stringent” decision ever imposed on a vaccine company.\r\n\n官方新闻机构新华社称这是有史以来对疫苗公司作出的“顶格处罚”及“最严格处罚”决定。\r\n\n“I’ve never heard of such a big fine,” said Shi Luwen, the head of the department of pharmaceutical administration at Peking University and an adviser to the government on health care. “It will give the people peace of mind about the ecological environment.”\r\n\n“我从来没听说过这么大金额的罚款，”北京大学药事管理系主任、医保方面的政府顾问史录文表示。“这能让人们对这个生态环境放心。”\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nAccording to a New York Times analysis of previous vaccine scandals in China, vaccine makers paid an average of $1.4 million in previous episodes.\r\n\n根据《纽约时报》对此前中国疫苗丑闻的分析，疫苗制造商在此前事件中支付的罚款平均为140万美元（约合人民币970万元）。\r\n\nSeparately, Changchun Changsheng will pay consumers who were injected with its rabies vaccines compensation of $29,000 to $94,000 each, according to a joint statement released by four government agencies on Tuesday. The company said it would set up a special compensation fund, according to a Tuesday filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange.\r\n\n另外，据周二一份由四个政府机构联合发布的公告显示，长春长生将向接种该公司狂犬疫苗的消费者提供20万到65万元人民币不等的赔偿。周二一份向深圳交易所提交的文件显示，该公司表示将设立一个专项赔偿基金。\r\n\nWhile the fine is likely to bring the current incarnation of Changchun Changsheng to an end, the company probably will not disappear forever. China needs a robust vaccine industry and is unlikely to fully close facilities that can help the country reach its health care ambitions.\r\n\n尽管这笔罚款很可能会让现阶段的长春长生关门，但该公司可能不会永远消失。中国需要一个强健的疫苗行业，不太可能将能够帮助该国实现其医疗保健雄心的设施完全关闭。\r\n\n“The state will not want to shut it down or completely eliminate it because of this matter,” said Mr. Wang, of Peking University. “This is not in line with the overall plan for our nation’s vaccine production.”\r\n\n“国家并不想说因为这个事情就关闭或者彻底消灭掉这个企业，”北京大学的王月丹表示。“这不符合我们国家疫苗生产的布局。”\r\n\nIn the wake of the latest scandal, President Xi Jinping has fired dozens of senior officials and promised a swift cleanup of the industry.\r\n\n最新的一起丑闻发生后，习近平主席将数十名高级官员撤职，并且承诺迅速整顿该行业。\r\n\nLi Jiang, the legal counsel for the China Food and Drug Administration, said Changchun Changsheng had engaged in “organized, persistent and harmful illegal activities.”\r\n\n中国国家食品药品监督管理局的法律顾问李江表示，长春长生进行了“具有组织性、持续性、危害性的违法活动”。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\n“It was a shocking and an extremely rare illegal case in the field of drug safety,” he was quoted by Xinhua as saying.\r\n\n这起事件“令人触目惊心，是药品安全领域极其罕见的违法案例，”新华社援引他的话表示。\r\n\nThe fine was imposed by the China Food and Drug Administration and the Jilin Provincial Food and Drug Administration. Trading of Changchun Changsheng has been halted since Aug. 31, after the company failed to disclose its half-year earnings report in time.\r\n\n罚款的决定由国家药品监督管理局和吉林省食品药品监督管理局作出。在未能及时公布其半年营收报告后，长春长生的股票自8月31号以来就已停牌。\r\n\n黄瑞黎(Sui-Lee Wee)是《纽约时报》驻京记者。\r\n\n\r\nElsie Chen对本文有研究贡献。\r\n\n\r\n翻译：纽约时报中文网\r\n"
