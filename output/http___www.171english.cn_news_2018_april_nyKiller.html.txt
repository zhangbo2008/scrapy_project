"鈥榁icious鈥� Killer of 11 Women Gets Death Penalty in China\r\nBEIJING 鈥� Thirty years after Gao Chengyong embarked on a succession of 11 rape-murders of women in northwest China, a court sentenced him to death on Friday, following an investigation that involved sifting through 230,000 fingerprints.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sentence by a court in Baiyin, a small city in Gansu Province, was not unexpected in China, which executes more prisoners than any other. But the verdict against Mr. Gao, 53, a farmer, itinerant worker and shopkeeper, was widely reported, and applauded, in China, where the killings drew intense attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淭he motives for the defendant Gao Chengyong鈥檚 crimes were utterly despicable, the means were utterly vicious, the nature of the crimes utterly vile,鈥� the court鈥檚 verdict stated, according to the China News Service, an official agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court found that Mr. Gao had killed 11 women, whom he usually followed to their homes. He murdered all but one around Baiyin; another woman was killed in Baotou, a city in the north Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. In many cases, he molested the women and dismembered their bodies. Besides homicide, he also was found guilty of rape and of defiling corpses. He stood trial last July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gao was arrested in 2016, the last murder had taken place 14 years earlier, and the police needed advanced forensic technology, as well as an element of chance, to link him to the crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nZhang Enwei, a forensic detective who helped solve the murders, said he had checked 230,000 sets of fingerprints trying to identify a suspect, Beijing News, a newspaper, reported on Friday. But Mr. Gao was one of hundreds of millions of rural migrants who move around, often slipping past city data checks, and he was not caught in the dragnet for fingerprints in Baiyin.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut by 2011, the detectives in Baiyin had acquired technology to trace DNA clues, and five years later a relative of Mr. Gao had his DNA sample taken after he was suspected of giving kickbacks. Their shared traits led the investigators to Mr. Gao, who was then running a small store in a school in Baiyin with his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Zhang said Mr. Gao was very calm when he was shown the evidence, according to the Beijing News. 鈥淏asically he did not offer too much of a defense,鈥欌�� Mr. Zhang said. 鈥淗e knew that this day would come.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gao said he would not appeal the sentence. In an interview last year, his defense lawyer, Zhu Aijun, denied reports that Mr. Gao had chosen as his victims only women and girls with long hair and dressed in red.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gao said he had 鈥渃hosen his targets for crimes at random,鈥� Mr. Zhu told a Chinese news website. 鈥淭hat was one of the reasons that it was so hard to crack the case for a long time.鈥�\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�1鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛堝偍鐧句寒锛�\r\n鍖椾含鈥斺�斿懆浜旓紝鍦ㄥ寘鎷瓫鏌�23涓囨灇鎸囩汗鍦ㄥ唴鐨勮皟鏌ョ粨鏉熷悗锛屼竴瀹舵硶闄㈠垽澶�30骞村墠鍦ㄤ腑鍥借タ鍖楅儴寮�濮嬪疄鏂戒簡11璧疯繛鐜己濂告潃浜烘鐨勯珮鎵垮媷姝诲垜銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍒ゅ喅鐢辩敇鑲冨皬鍩庡競鐧介摱涓�瀹舵硶闄綔鍑恒�傚湪澶勫喅浜烘暟瓒呰繃鍏朵粬浠讳綍鍥藉鐨勪腑鍥斤紝杩欎竴鍒ゅ喅骞朵笉鎰忓銆傝�屽鐜板勾53宀佺殑鍐滄皯銆佹皯宸ュ拰鍟嗗簵鑰佹澘楂樻壙鍕囩殑鍒ゅ喅鍦ㄤ腑鍥借骞挎硾鎶ラ亾锛屽苟鍙楀埌绉拌禐銆傛湰妗堟墍娑夋潃浜轰簨浠舵浘寮曞彂寮虹儓鍏虫敞銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鎹畼鏂归�氳绀句腑鏂扮ぞ鎶ラ亾锛屾硶闄㈢殑鍒ゅ喅涔﹀啓閬擄紝鈥滆鍛婁汉楂樻壙鍕囩姱缃姩鏈烘瀬鍏跺崙鍔ｃ�佺姱缃墜娈垫瀬鍏舵畫蹇嶏紝鐘姜鎬ц川鏋佸叾鎭跺姡銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n娉曢櫌璁ゅ畾楂樻壙鍕囨潃瀹充簡11鍚嶅コ鎬с�備粬閫氬父浼氳窡韪ス浠嚦鍏跺涓�傞櫎鍏朵腑涓�璧峰锛屾墍鏈夋浠堕兘鍙戠敓鍦ㄧ櫧閾朵竴甯︺�傚彟涓�鍚嶅コ鎬у湪涓浗鍖楅儴鍐呰挋鍙よ嚜娌诲尯涓嬭緰鐨勫寘澶村競琚潃銆傚湪澶氳捣妗堜欢涓紝浠栫尌浜靛彈瀹充汉骞跺皢鍏惰偄瑙ｃ�傞櫎鏁呮剰鏉�浜虹姜澶栵紝浠栬繕琚垽鐘湁寮哄ジ缃拰渚颈灏镐綋缃�備粬浜庡幓骞�7鏈堝彈瀹°��\r\n\r\n\r\n楂樻壙鍕�2016骞磋鎹曟椂锛屾渶鍚庝竴璧锋潃浜烘宸茬粡杩囧幓浜�14骞淬�傝鏂归渶瑕佺敤鍏堣繘鐨勬硶璇佹妧鏈紝杩樻湁涓�涓濊繍姘旓紝鎵嶈兘鎶婁粬鍜岄偅浜涚姱缃仈绯昏捣鏉ャ��\r\n\r\n\r\n銆婃柊浜姤銆嬪懆浜旀姤閬擄紝鍗忓姪渚︽煡鐩稿叧妗堜欢鐨勬硶鍖讳睛鏌ヤ汉鍛樺紶鎭╀紵璇达紝浠栨煡楠屼簡23涓囨灇鎸囩汗锛岃瘯鍥炬壘鍑哄珜鐤戜汉銆備絾楂樻壙鍕囨槸鍦ㄥ悇鍦板娉㈢殑鏁颁嚎鍐滄皯宸ヤ箣涓�锛岀粡甯稿湪鍩庡競鏁版嵁妫�鏌ヤ腑琚紡杩囥�傚湪鐧介摱鐨勬寚绾圭綏缃戜腑锛屼粬娌℃湁琚姄鍒般��\r\n\r\n\r\n楂樻壙鍕囪鍒ょ姱涓�11璧峰寘鎷己濂哥姜鍜屼井杈卞案浣撶姜鍦ㄥ唴鐨勭姜琛岋紝瀵逛粬鐨勫垽鍐冲湪涓浗鍙楀埌绉拌禐銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗗埌浜�2011骞达紝鐧介摱鐨勪睛鏌ヤ汉鍛樺凡缁忔帉鎻′簡杩借釜DNA绾跨储鐨勬妧鏈�備簲骞村悗锛岄珮鎵垮媷鐨勪竴涓翰鎴氬湪娑夊珜鎻愪緵鍥炴墸鍚庢帴鍙椾簡DNA鏍锋湰閲囬泦銆備粬浠殑鍏卞悓鐗圭偣淇冧娇璋冩煡浜哄憳鎵惧埌浜嗛珮鎵垮媷銆傚綋鏃讹紝楂樻壙鍕囧拰濡诲瓙鍦ㄧ櫧閾跺競鐨勪竴鎵�瀛︽牎閲岀粡钀ョ潃涓�瀹跺皬鍟嗗簵銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鎹�婃柊浜姤銆嬫姤閬擄紝寮犳仼浼熻楂樻壙鍕囬潰瀵瑰嚭绀虹殑璇佹嵁寰堝喎闈欍�傗�滃熀鏈笂鏄病鏈夎繘琛岃繃澶氳京瑙ｏ紝鈥濆紶鎭╀紵璇淬�傗�滀粬灏辩煡閬撲粬浼氭湁杩欎箞涓�澶╃殑銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n楂樻壙鍕囪〃绀轰笉涓婅瘔銆傚湪鍘诲勾鐨勪竴娆￠噰璁夸腑锛屼粬鐨勮京鎶ゅ緥甯堟湵鐖卞啗鍚﹁浜嗛珮鎵垮媷涓撻棬鎸戠┛绾㈣。銆佺暀闀垮彂鐨勫コ鎬т綔妗堢殑鎶ラ亾銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鏈辩埍鍐涘憡璇変腑鍥界殑涓�瀹舵柊闂荤綉绔欙紝楂樻壙鍕囪浠栨槸鈥滀复鏃堕�夋嫨鐩爣闅忔満浣滄锛岃繖涔熸槸瀵艰嚧妗堜欢闀挎椂闂撮毦浠ヤ睛鐮寸殑鍘熷洜涔嬩竴鈥濄��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍌ㄧ櫨浜�(Chris Buckley)鏄�婄航绾︽椂鎶ャ�嬮┗浜鑰呫��\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氶檲浜︿涵"
