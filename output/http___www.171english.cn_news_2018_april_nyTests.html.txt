"One afternoon when I was running later than usual, I recognized a familiar face among the patients waiting to see me. A voluble newspaper fanatic, the gentleman, in his 70s, was usually eager to discuss the latest headlines with me. That day, however, he was remarkably quiet. He was suffering from the flu. \"I'm really feeling no good,\" he rasped.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about his symptoms and examining him, I suggested fluids, rest and maybe a cough suppressant and nasal decongestant. I saw the corners of his eyes and mouth fall. I understood.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was waiting for me to offer him a prescription, or to order more tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew that he didn't really need blood drawn or a chest X-ray, and he certainly didn't need antibiotics for the virus that was causing his symptoms. But I also knew what would happen if I took the time to explain why and to answer all the questions that would no doubt follow: irritated looks from other patients, the staff or even my colleagues because of the time I spent with one patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffering unnecessary care would, in fact, be faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, when I bumped into a senior colleague and explained my quandary, he simply shrugged. \"In training, the most important lesson they teach you is when not to do something,\" he said. \"But in real life, it's all about staying out of trouble and surviving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Even if that means ordering things you might not think necessary,\" he added with a wink.\r\n\r\n\r\nI recalled my colleague's words this week when I read a study about the excessive and unnecessary care patients receive and how their doctors feel about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several decades now, researchers have pointed to excessive care as an important factor behind spiraling health care costs. Some studies have estimated that up to 30 percent of the care delivered to patients in the United States is unnecessary, and sometimes even harmful. More and more policy makers and insurers have been addressing the overuse problem like a calorie-reduction plan to lose weight, arguing that eliminating excess from our medical diet is critical to streamlining our corpulent health care system.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as anyone who has ever tried to shed pounds knows, deciding to cut extra calories is one thing. What happens at the table is an entirely different matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis week's Archives of Internal Medicine offers a glimpse of what happens at one \"table\" of health care: the primary care doctor's office. Researchers analyzed more than 600 responses to a nationwide mail survey that went out to primary care doctors and found that nearly half of them believed that patients in their practice were receiving too much care. Almost a third acknowledged that it wasn't just other providers at fault; it was also their own way of providing care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Doctors aren't oblivious to what is going on,\" said Dr. Brenda Sirovich, the lead author and an associate professor of medicine in the Outcomes Group at the White River Junction Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Vermont and at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice. \"They recognize that something is wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctors surveyed attributed the pressure to overtreat patients primarily to three factors. Almost half believed that inadequate time allotted to patients led them to order more tests or refer to specialists. More than three-quarters also believed that the fear of being sued or perceived as not doing enough put undue pressure on them to order more. A doctor might, for example, order an unnecessary CT scan for a patient who had only a minor forehead bruise from a fall but a perfect neurologic exam.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost notably, more than half the doctors believed that the current quality measures and clinical guidelines endorsed by health care experts and insurers as a way to rein in excesses were in fact having the opposite effect. The guidelines might, for example, require that patients with high blood pressure and diabetes have a specific blood test every three months and take high blood pressure medications as soon as their blood pressure exceeds 140. Because insurers are increasingly linking payment to these guidelines, physicians must strictly follow the quality measures to be paid, regardless of the patient's specific situation. Ironically, most of these quality measures are based on, well, more testing and treatments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Guidelines in general set a bar for not enough care,\" Dr. Sirovich said. \"There aren't any guidelines that set a bar for too much care.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers have proposed that doctors might prescribe unnecessary care for financial gain, but only 3 percent of doctors in this study believed their decisions were based on a desire to generate extra revenue. Dr. Calvin Chou, author of an editorial accompanying the study and a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, believes that overtreating patients stems not from an active desire to do or gain something, but rather from a sense of overwhelming helplessness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Many doctors feel like they are on a treadmill and are running scared because of malpractice and having to check off all the checkboxes of quality measures,\" Dr. Chou said. \"They feel like they are in an oppressive situation that they can't do anything about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNonetheless, there was evidence that doctors were not resigned to their professional plight. Seventy percent of the physicians took the time to answer and return the mailed survey, in part, Dr. Sirovich believes, because \"doctors are interested and want to talk about these issues.\" Moreover, a majority of doctors surveyed acknowledged being curious about how their colleagues practiced; and well over half asked to see a report the researchers offered on how practices in their own communities differed from others. All of this \"suggests that doctors are open not only to changes in their own practices, but also to working together to realign the incentives of the system,\" Dr. Sirovich said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe added: \"It all comes down to doctors and patients sitting in the office and deciding what to do. We are not going to be successful in reducing unnecessary care until physicians are also engaged.\"\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�3鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛堥檲钁嗙惓鍖荤敓锛�\r\n鏈夊ぉ涓嬪崍锛屾垜鐨勯棬璇婃椂闂存瘮寰�甯告嫋寰椾箙浜嗕竴鐐广�傚湪鍊欒瘖鐨勭梾浜轰腑锛屾垜鐪嬪埌涓�寮犵啛鎮夌殑鑴搞�傝繖浣嶈�佸厛鐢熶粖骞�70澶氫簡锛岀埍鐪嬫姤绾镐緝澶у北锛屽钩甯告�绘槸婊旀粩涓嶇粷鍦拌窡鎴戣璁烘柊闂荤儹鐐归棶棰樸�傚彲閭ｄ竴澶╋紝浠栧嵈鏄庢樉鍙戣敨鍎裤�傛祦鎰熸鎶樼（鐫�浠栥�傗�滄垜鐪熺殑鎰熻寰堜笉鑸掓湇锛屸�濊�佸厛鐢熷０闊虫矙鍝戝湴璇淬��\r\n\r\n\r\n鎴戝惉浠栨弿杩颁簡鐥囩姸锛屽仛浜嗘鏌ワ紝鐒跺悗缁欏嚭鍖诲槺锛氬鍠濇按锛屽浼戞伅锛屼篃璁稿彲浠ュ幓鑽簵涔扮偣姝㈠挸鍜岀紦瑙ｉ蓟濉炵殑闈炲鏂硅嵂銆傝繖鏃讹紝鎴戠湅瑙佷簡浠栫炕浜嗕釜鐧界溂锛岃�锋媺涓嬪槾瑙掋�傛垜鏄庣櫧浜嗐��\r\n\r\n\r\n浠栨寚鏈涙垜鑳界粰浠栧紑澶勬柟鑽紝瑕佷箞灏卞啀澶氬仛鍑犻」妫�鏌ャ�� \r\n\r\n\r\n鎴戠煡閬撲粬鍏跺疄鐪熺殑骞朵笉闇�瑕佹娊琛�鍖栭獙鎴栨槸鎷峏鍏夎兏鐗囷紝鑰屼笖瑕佸浠樺鑷村叾涓嶉�傜棁鐘剁殑娴佹劅鐥呮瘨锛屼篃缁濆鐢ㄤ笉鐫�鎶楃敓绱犮�備絾鎴戜篃鐭ラ亾锛屽鏋滄垜鑺辨椂闂磋窡浠栬В閲婏紝涓�涓�鍥炵瓟鎵�鏈夌浉鍏抽棶棰樼殑璇濓紝鎺ヤ笅鏉ョ瓑鐫�鎴戠殑浼氭槸浠�涔堬細鍏朵粬鐥呬汉銆侀棬璇婂伐浣滀汉鍛樼敋鑷虫槸鍚屼簨鐨勫喎鑴糕�斺�斿洜涓烘垜鍦ㄤ竴涓梾浜鸿韩涓婅姳浜嗗お澶氭椂闂淬��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n璇村埌搴曪紝鎻愪緵涓嶅繀瑕佺殑鍖荤枟鏈嶅姟瑕佺棝蹇埄绱㈠緱澶氫簡銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍚庢潵锛屾垜涓庝竴浣嶈祫娣卞悓浜嬪伓閬囷紝璺熶粬璇磋捣浜嗘垜鐨勪袱闅惧澧冦�備粬鍙槸鑰镐簡鑰歌偐銆傗�滀笂瀛︽椂锛屼粬浠暀缁欎綘鐨勬渶閲嶈鐨勪竴璇炬槸鍦ㄥ摢浜涙椂鍊欎笉搴斿仛鍝簺浜嬶紝鈥濅粬璇达細鈥滀絾鍦ㄧ幇瀹炵敓娲讳腑锛屼竴鍒囬兘涓嶈繃鏄负浜嗗埆鎯归夯鐑︼紝鎸轰綇灏辨槸鑳滃埄銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n浠栨尋鎸ょ溂锛岃ˉ鍏呴亾锛屸�滃嵆浣胯繖鎰忓懗鐫�寮�閭ｄ簺浣犳槑鐭ラ亾涓嶅繀瑕佺殑妫�鏌ュ崟鍜屽鏂广�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欐槦鏈燂紝鐪嬪埌涓�椤圭爺绌舵姤鍛婃椂锛屾垜绔嬫椂鎯宠捣浜嗚繖浣嶅悓浜嬬殑璇濄�傝椤圭爺绌惰皟鏌ヤ簡鐥呬汉鎵�鎺ュ彈鐨勮繃搴﹀拰涓嶅繀瑕佸尰鐤楃殑鐘跺喌锛屼互鍙婁粬浠殑鍖荤敓瀵规浜嬬殑鐪嬫硶銆� \r\n\r\n\r\n浠庡嚑鍗佸勾鍓嶅埌鐜板湪锛岀爺绌惰�呬滑涓�鐩村绉帮紝杩囧害鍖荤枟鏄鑷村尰鐤楀紑鏀笉鏂�ュ墽涓婃定鐨勯噸瑕佹綔鍦ㄥ師鍥犮�傛嵁涓�浜涚爺绌朵及娴嬶紝鍦ㄧ編鍥斤紝鎮ｈ�呮墍鎺ュ彈鐨勫尰鐤楁湇鍔′腑锛岃秴杩�30%骞舵棤蹇呰锛屾湁鏃跺�欑敋鑷虫槸鏈夊鐨勩�傝秺鏉ヨ秺澶氱殑鏀跨瓥鍒跺畾鑰呭拰淇濋櫓鍏徃寮�濮嬪叧娉ㄥ尰鐤楄祫婧愭互鐢ㄧ殑闂銆傚湪浠栦滑鐪嬫潵锛岃繖灏卞儚闄嶄綆鍗¤矾閲屾憚鍏ヤ笌鍑忚偉涔嬮棿鐨勫叧绯讳竴鏍凤紝鎯宠绮剧畝鑷冭偪涓嶅牚鐨勫尰鐤楁湇鍔′綋绯伙紝鍏抽敭渚垮湪浜庡噺灏戞瘡涓汉浠庘�滃尰鐤楀ぇ椁愨�濅腑鍒嗕竴鏉竟鐨勬満浼氥��\r\n\r\n\r\n鐒惰�岋紝姝ｅ姣忎釜鏇剧粡灏濊瘯杩囩槮韬殑浜洪兘鐔熺煡鐨勶紝鍐冲畾鍑忓皯鍗¤矾閲屾憚鍏ラ噺鏄竴鍥炰簨锛岀湡鍧愬埌椁愭涓婏紝閭ｅ氨鍙堟槸鍙﹀涓�鍥炰簨浜嗐��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏈懆鍑虹増鐨勩�婂唴绉戝尰瀛︽。妗堛��(Archives of Internal Medicine)鏉傚織灏卞尰鐤楁湇鍔＄郴缁熶腑鐨勪竴寮犫�滈妗屸�濃�斺�斿熀灞備繚鍋ュ尰鐢熺殑璇婂鈥斺�斿姞浠ュ瑙嗐�傜爺绌朵汉鍛樺鍏ㄧ編鍥借寖鍥村唴鐨勫熀灞備繚鍋ュ尰鐢熻繘琛屼簡涓�椤归偖浠堕棶鍗疯皟鏌ャ�傚瀵勫洖鐨�600澶氫唤鍥炲杩涜鍒嗘瀽鍚庯紝鐮旂┒鑰呭彂鐜帮紝灏嗚繎鍗婃暟鐨勮璋冩煡鑰呰涓猴紝鑷繁鎺ヨ瘖鐨勭梾浜烘帴鍙椾簡杩囧鐨勫尰鐤楁湇鍔°�傝繎1/3鐨勪汉鎵胯锛岃繖涓嶄粎浠呮槸鍒鍖荤枟鏈烘瀯鐨勯棶棰橈紝浠栦滑鑷繁涔熶竴鏍烽殢娉㈤�愭祦銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滃尰鐢熶滑骞堕潪瀵规鍦ㄥ彂鐢熺殑浜嬩竴鏃犳墍鐭ワ紝浠栦滑鐭ラ亾鏈変簺浜嬫槸涓嶅鐨勩�傗�濊椤圭爺绌剁殑涓昏浣滆�呫�佽揪鐗硅寘鏂崼鐢熸斂绛栦笌涓村簥璇婄枟鐮旂┒鎵�鍖诲鍓暀鎺堝竷浼﹁揪路甯岀綏缁村(Brenda Sirovich)鎸囧嚭銆傚ス杩樹换鑱屼簬浣涜挋鐗瑰窞鐧芥渤鍙ｉ��浼嶅啗浜哄尰鐤椾腑蹇�(White River Junction Veterans Affairs Medical Center)鐨勫尰鐤椾骇鍑鸿瘎浼板皬缁�(Outcomes Group)銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鎺ュ彈璋冩煡鐨勫尰鐢熶滑琛ㄧず锛屽鐥呬汉杩囧害娌荤枟鐨勫帇鍔涗富瑕佹簮鑷笁涓洜绱犮�傝繎鍗婃暟浜鸿涓猴紝鍒嗛厤鍒版瘡涓梾浜鸿韩涓婄殑闂ㄨ瘖鏃堕棿涓嶈冻瀵艰嚧浜嗗熀灞備繚鍋ュ尰鐢熷寮�妫�鏌ユ垨寤鸿鐥呬汉鍘讳笓绉戝尰鐢熻浆璇娿�傝秴杩�3/4鐨勪汉杩樿〃绀猴紝鎷呭績琚捣璇夋垨鏄鎸囪矗鐜╁拷鑱屽畧鐨勫帇鍔涜揩浣夸粬浠姹傜梾浜哄仛鏇村鐨勬鏌ャ�備緥濡傦紝瀵逛簬涓�浣嶅洜涓鸿穼鍊掕�岄澶寸暐寰摝浼ょ殑鐥呬汉锛屾湰鏉ュ父瑙勭殑绁炵粡瀛︽鏌ュ氨宸茶冻澶燂紝浣嗗尰鐢熷嵈鍙兘浼氳姹備粬澶氬仛涓�娆℃病鏈夊繀瑕佹鏌ョ殑CT鎵弿銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鏈�鍊煎緱鍏虫敞鐨勬槸锛岃秴杩囧崐鏁扮殑鍖荤敓璁や负锛屽綋鍓嶇殑鍖荤枟璐ㄩ噺璇勪及鏍囧噯鍜屼复搴婃不鐤楁寚鍗楄櫧鐒舵槸鐢卞尰瀛︿笓瀹跺拰淇濋櫓鍏徃鍑轰簬鎺у埗鍖荤枟寮�鏀殑鐩殑鑰屽埗瀹氱殑锛屼絾瀹冧滑鐨勫疄闄呮晥鏋滃嵈閫傚緱鍏跺弽銆備緥濡傦紝娌荤枟鎸囧崡鍙兘浼氳姹傛偅鏈夐珮琛�鍘嬪拰绯栧翱鐥呯殑鎮ｈ�呮瘡涓変釜鏈堟帴鍙椾竴娆＄壒瀹氱殑琛�娑插寲楠岋紝骞朵笖鍦ㄨ鍘嬭秴杩�140姣背姹炴煴鏃剁珛鍗虫湇鐢ㄩ檷鍘嬭嵂鐗┿�傜敱浜庝繚闄╁叕鍙歌秺鏉ヨ秺澶氬湴灏嗗尰鐤椾繚闄╄禂浠樹笌杩欎簺娌荤枟鎸囧崡鎸傞挬锛屽尰鐢熶滑蹇呴』涓ユ牸閬靛畧鍖荤枟璐ㄩ噺璇勪及鏍囧噯鎵嶈兘鎷垮埌閽憋紝鑰屼笉绠＄梾浜虹殑鍏蜂綋鎯呭喌涓轰綍銆傚叿鏈夎鍒烘剰鍛崇殑鏄紝澶у鏁板尰鐤楄川閲忚瘎浼版爣鍑嗛兘鏄缓绔嬪湪澶氭鏌ュ拰澶氭不鐤楃殑鍩虹涓婄殑銆� \r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滄不鐤楁寚鍗楅�氬父鍙瀹氭不鐤椾笉瓒崇殑鏍囧噯锛屾病鏈夊灏戞寚鍗椾负杩囧害娌荤枟璁惧畾浜嗘爣鍑嗭紝鈥濆笇缃楃淮濂囪銆� \r\n\r\n\r\n鏈変簺浜烘寚鍑猴紝鍖荤敓澶氬紑娌℃湁蹇呰鐨勬鏌ユ槸涓轰簡鐗熷埄锛屼絾鍦ㄦ椤圭爺绌朵腑锛屼粎鏈�3%鐨勫尰鐢熻涓鸿嚜宸卞仛鍑虹殑鍖诲鍐崇瓥鏄缓绔嬩簬鎯冲璧氱偣鍎块挶鐨勫熀纭�涓婄殑銆傚姞宸炲ぇ瀛︽棫閲戝北鍒嗘牎鍖诲鏁欐巿銆佹棫閲戝北閫�浼嶅啗浜哄尰瀛︿腑蹇冪殑鍗″皵鏂嚶峰懆锛圕alvin Chou锛岄煶璇戯級鍖荤敓鍦ㄨ繖椤圭爺绌跺彂琛ㄦ椂涓哄叾鎾板啓璇勮鍛樻枃绔犮�備粬璁や负锛屽鐥呬汉杩涜杩囧害娌荤枟鐨勬牴婧愪笉鍦ㄤ簬涓�瀹氭兂瑕佸仛鐐逛粈涔堟垨鏄崬鍒扮偣浠�涔堬紝鑰屽湪浜庝竴绉嶅帇鍊掍竴鍒囩殑鏃犺兘涓哄姏鎰熴�� \r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滆澶氬尰鐢熸劅瑙夌疆韬窇姝ユ満涓婏紝鍙【濂嬪姏鍓嶅锛岀敓鎬曞け鑱屽嚭閿欙紝浜庢槸鎭ㄤ笉寰楀湪姣忎竴椤瑰尰鐤楄川閲忚瘎浼版爣鍑嗗墠闈㈡墦涓婂鍕撅紝鈥濆懆鍖荤敓璇达紝鈥滀粬浠嚜瑙夎韩澶勫急鍔夸絾鍗村姝ゆ棤璁″彲鏂姐�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鐒惰�岋紝鏈夎瘉鎹〃鏄庯紝鍖荤敓骞舵湭灞堟湇浜庤嚜宸辩殑鑱屼笟鍥板銆傚湪涓婅堪鐮旂┒涓紝70%鐨勫尰鐢熻姳鏃堕棿鍥炵瓟浜嗚皟鏌ラ棶鍗峰苟灏嗗叾瀵勫洖銆傚湪甯岀綏缁村鍖荤敓鐪嬫潵锛屽叾閮ㄥ垎鍘熷洜鍦ㄤ簬鈥滃尰鐢熶滑鎰挎剰鎺㈣杩欎簺闂鈥濄�傛澶栵紝澶ч儴鍒嗘帴鍙楄皟鏌ョ殑鍖荤敓琛ㄧず浜嗗鍏朵粬鍚岃鐨勪复搴婂疄璺电殑濂藉銆傝秴杩囧崐鏁扮殑浜鸿姹傜爺绌惰�呮彁渚涗竴浠藉叧浜庢帴鍙楄皟鏌ヨ�呮墍鍦ㄧぞ鍖轰笌鍏朵粬鍦板尯涓村簥瀹炶返涓嶅悓涔嬪鐨勬瘮杈冩姤鍛婏紝渚涗粬浠弬闃呫�傛墍鏈夎繖浜涢兘鈥滈绀虹潃鍖荤敓浠笉浠呭鏀瑰彉鑷韩涓村簥瀹炶返鎸佸紑鏄庢�佸害锛岃�屼笖鎰挎剰鍚屽績鍗忓姏锛岃鍖荤枟浣撶郴閲嶆柊鍙樺緱鍏锋湁鍚稿紩鍔涳紝鈥濆笇缃楃淮濂囧尰鐢熻〃绀恒��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n濂硅ˉ鍏呴亾锛屸�滆繖鏈�缁堣闈犲尰鎮ｅ弻鏂瑰潗鍦ㄤ竴璧凤紝鍏卞悓鍐冲畾浣曞幓浣曚粠銆傞櫎闈炲尰鐢熶篃鍏ㄨ韩蹇冨湴鎶曞叆鍏朵腑锛屽惁鍒欏墛鍑忎笉蹇呰鐨勫尰鐤楁湇鍔℃槸涓嶅彲鑳借幏寰楁垚鍔熺殑銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n闄堣憜鐞�(Pauline W.
