And this is a younger, self-made Asian class that is redefining what it means to be ultra-wealthy.\r\n\n根据瑞士的瑞银集团(UBS)和咨询机构普华永道(PwC)对财富进行的一项研究，中国去年每周都会新增两名亿万富翁。而且，这是亚洲一个较为年轻的、靠个人奋斗成功的阶层，他们正在重新定义身为超级富豪的意义。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n科技造就了中国的许多新亿万富翁。\nChina added a net total of 55 new billionaires last year. (Actually 106 people in the country joined the superrich league during the period, but almost half of that amount also dropped off the list.) That brought the grand total of billionaires in the country to 373, or nearly one in five of the global total.\r\n\n中国去年共计增加55名亿万富翁（实际上，该国有106人在该时期加入了超级富豪的行列，但有约半数跌出了这个名单）。这让该国亿万富翁的总数达到373人，几乎占全球总数的五分之一。\r\n\nBillionaire wealth in China has increased almost 40 percent, to $1.12 trillion year-on-year. Based on current rates of growth, Chinese billionaires will outnumber their American counterparts within four years.\r\n\n中国亿万富翁的财富同比增长了近40%，达到1.12万亿美元。按照目前的增长速率，中国亿万富翁的数量将在四年内超越美国。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nTechnology is helping to line the pockets of many new Chinese billionaires — including Zhang Yiming of the video-sharing app ByteDance and Wang Jian, the co-founder of the Shenzhen-based gene sequencing company BGI. China is now producing almost as many unicorns, or companies worth at least $1 billion, as the United States.\r\n\n科技帮助许多中国新亿万富翁的口袋鼓了起来——包括视频分享应用程序字节跳动的张一鸣，以及总部位于深圳的基因测序公司华大基因的共同创始人汪建。中国如今出现的独角兽公司数量几乎跟美国一样多。独角兽指那些估值至少在10亿美元的公司。\r\n\nBut China’s billionaires differ markedly from their global peers. With an average age of 55 years, they are almost a decade younger. They create wealth faster and take their companies public earlier; 17 percent of China’s new billionaires founded their businesses within the last ten years, more than twice as many as in the United States.\r\n\n但中国的亿万富翁们与全球亿万富翁有着显著不同。他们平均年龄55岁，几乎要比全球水平年轻10岁。他们创造财富的速度更快，公司上市的时间也更早；中国新亿万富翁中的17%都是在过去10年里创办自己公司的，这个数字比美国多了两倍。\r\n\nChinese billionaires are also bigger risk takers, which resulted in the high turnover in their ranks that saw 51 people lose the title there last year. As local authorities clamp down on corruption, China’s wealthy will also fear attracting too much scrutiny.\r\n\n中国亿万富翁也承担了更大的风险，这也导致该群体的高更替率，去年有51人失去了这个头衔。随着地方当局反腐，中国的富人也会对吸引太多审视目光感到担忧。\r\n\nSharon Lam是路透热点透视(Reuters Breakingviews)的助理编辑。欲知更多独立评论及分析，点击访问breakingviews.com。\r\n\n翻译：安妮\r\n"
