"Teachers in Two US States Walk Out in Funding Protests\r\nTens of thousands of teachers in the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Kentucky took to the streets Monday, demanding better pay and more funding for education.\r\n\r\nClassrooms in both states 鈥� Oklahoma in the southwestern part of the country, and Kentucky in the mid-South 鈥� were shuttered, some because of the teacher walkouts, some because of scheduled spring breaks.\r\n\r\nThe teacher protests in Oklahoma City and Frankfort, the capital cities of Oklahoma and Kentucky respectively, mirrored a similar nine-day strike in West Virginia, where teachers recently won a pay raise to end their walkout.\r\n\r\nIn Oklahoma, with the third-lowest teacher salaries among the 50 U.S. states, the protesters said funding concessions made by state lawmakers last week were not big enough to improve education there. Some school systems only hold classes four days a week for lack of funding for a five-day week and use 20-year-old textbooks.\r\nThe Oklahoma teachers' union is demanding $10,000 raises for teachers, $5,000 pay boosts for support staff and $200 million in new education funding. But state lawmakers only agreed to smaller amounts: a $6,100 teacher pay boost, $1,250 for support staff and $50 million in new education funding.\r\n\r\nEven with the pay boost, some Oklahoma teachers said they have to take on second and third jobs, such as working at restaurants or mowing laws, in order to make enough money to pay their household bills.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky, teachers protested changes to their pension plans that lawmakers tucked into a bill about sewage and demanded more state funding for school systems. The teachers decried the fact that there is no change to cost-of-living adjustments to their pensions and that they will have a limited number of sick days they can put toward their retirement.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�3鏃� 浣滆��:缇庡浗涔嬮煶甯冮浄寰疯繄灏�(Ken Bredemeier)\r\n缇庡浗濂ュ厠鎷夎嵎椹窞鍜岃偗濉斿熀宸炲叕绔嬩腑灏忓鏁欏笀鏄熸湡涓�璧颁笂琛楀ご瑕佹眰鍔犺祫鍜屾彁楂樻暀鑲茬粡璐广��\r\n缇庡浗瑗垮崡閮ㄥゥ鍏嬫媺鑽烽┈宸炲拰涓崡閮ㄨ偗濉斿熀宸炵殑鏁欏鍛ㄤ竴閮借鍏抽棴锛屾湁浜涙槸鍥犱负鑰佸笀缃㈡暀锛屾湁浜涙槸鍥犱负璁″垝涓殑鏄ュ亣銆�\r\n鏁欏笀浠垎鍒湪棣栧簻鍩庡競淇勫厠鎷変綍椹煄鍜屾硶鍏板厠绂忎妇琛屾姉璁泦浼氥�� 鏈�杩戠編鍥借タ缁村悏灏间簹宸炵殑鏁欏笀涔熶妇琛岃繃绫讳技鐨勪负鏈�9澶╃殑缃㈡暀锛屾渶鍚庝簤鍙栧埌鍔犺柂銆�\r\n濂ュ厠鎷夎嵎椹窞鐨勬暀甯堣柂璧勫湪缇庡浗50涓窞涓帓鍚嶅�掓暟绗笁锛屾姉璁�呬滑琛ㄧず锛屽窞璁細涓婂懆灏辨暀鑲茬粡璐规墍浣滅殑璁╂涓嶈冻浠ユ敼鍠勫綋鍦版暀鑲层�傜敱浜庣粡璐逛笉瓒筹紝鏈変簺瀛︽牎绯荤粺姣忓懆鍙湁鍥涘ぉ寮�璇撅紝浣跨敤鐨勪篃鏄�20骞村墠鐨勬暀绉戜功銆�\r\n\r\n鑲鍩哄窞鏁欏笀鍦ㄩ搴滄硶鍏板厠绂忔姉璁墛鍑忛��浼戠鍒┿�傦紙2018骞�3鏈�8鏃ワ級\r\n\r\n濂ュ厠鎷夎嵎椹窞鏁欏笀宸ヤ細瑕佹眰涓烘暀甯堟瘡浜哄姞钖�1涓囩編鍏冿紝涓烘暀瀛﹁緟鍔╀汉鍛樺姞钖簲鍗冪編鍏冿紝骞跺鍔犳彁渚�2浜跨編鍏冪殑鏁欒偛缁忚垂銆傜洰鍓嶅窞璁細鍙悓鎰忎负鏁欏笀鍔犺柂6,100缇庡厓锛屾暀瀛﹁緟鍔╀汉鍛�1,250缇庡厓锛屽鍔犳暀鑲茶祫閲�5鍗冧竾缇庡厓銆�\r\n濂ュ厠鎷夎嵎椹窞鐨勪竴浜涙暀甯堣〃绀猴紝鍗充娇鍔犺柂锛屼粬浠篃涓嶅緱涓嶄笟浣欏吋宸紝濡傚湪椁愰鎵撳伐鎴栦慨鍓崏鍧紝浠ヨ禋鍙栬冻澶熺殑閽辨潵鏀粯瀹跺涵璐﹀崟銆�\r\n鍦ㄨ偗濉斿熀宸烇紝鏁欏笀浠姉璁窞璁細鍦ㄦ湁鍏虫薄姘村拰宸炴暀鑲茬粡璐圭殑娉曟涓杩涗簡淇敼鏁欏笀鍏昏�侀噾鐨勫唴瀹广�傛寜鐓ф硶妗堬紝鏁欏笀鐨勫吇鑰侀噾涓嶄細闅忕潃鐢熸椿璐圭敤鐨勬彁楂樿�屾彁楂橈紝鑰屼笖浠栦滑鐨勭梾鍋囦篃鍙兘鏈夐檺鍦版姌鍚堟垚閫�浼戝勾璧勶紝杩欏紩璧蜂簡鏁欏笀浠殑寮虹儓涓嶆弧銆�"
