Fashion experts have assured us that we are not breaking the law if we slip into those white jeans today!\n夏天已经临近，我们可以重新穿上白色的衣着。时尚专家告诉我们，如果今天就偷偷地穿上白色牛仔裤，那也未尝不可！\nBut there's a better way to get the benefits of white year-round -- by putting it in your body instead of on it! We're often told to \"eat a rainbow\" and we aim for the guideline that says the more color a food has, the better it is. However, color is just one indicator of nutrient content. Produce that wears white could be just as valuable. In fact, some white vegetables contribute substantial quantities of nutrients that we seem to be missing most often (also known as shortfall nutrients), like potassium, magnesium and fiber.\n但有一个更好的方式可以让你在新的一整年里更加受益――那就是把白色放进你的身体里，而不仅是穿在身上。我们经常被灌输这样的饮食原则，要“吃出一座彩虹来”，也就是说一种食物的颜色越多，它就越好。不过，颜色只是判断营养含量的一个标准。一些披着白色外衣的食物也具有同样的营养价值。事实上，一些白色蔬菜能补充我们平时所缺失的大量营养物质，即改善营养不足的状态，这些物质包括钾，镁以及纤维。\nHere's how to wear white in a way that is truly one size fits all:\n以下就是如何用白色丰富营养，这适用于每一个人：\nCauliflower\n花椰菜\nThis veggie has been deemed one of the hottest trends of the year. Along with the other members of the cruciferous family, like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and Brussels sprouts, cauliflower contains sulfur compounds that are associated with fighting cancer, strengthening bone tissue and maintaining healthy blood vessels.\n这种蔬菜已被认为是今年最热门的蔬菜之一。和其它十字花科的蔬菜一样，如西兰花，菜花，卷心菜和芽甘蓝，花椰菜含有与抗癌，增强骨组织和维持血管健康相关的含硫化合物。Mushrooms\n蘑菇\n\nGet ready for this list: Mushrooms are low in calories, fat-free, cholesterol-free, gluten-free, with barely any sodium, and yet they carry a wealth of selenium, potassium, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin D. Mushrooms are also hearty and filling so they can help you control your weight without compromising taste. And they're a rich source of umami, the fifth basic taste after sweet, salty, bitter and sour. They can help simple dishes come alive.\n来看看它的简历：低热量，不含脂肪、胆固醇、谷蛋白，几乎不含钠，然而它们带有丰富的硒，钾，核黄素，烟酸和维生素D。蘑菇也可以使人神清气爽，充满能量，它们能帮助你控制体重但却不影响口感。而且它们还十分鲜美，这是除了甜，咸，苦，酸之外的第五个基本口味。它们可以让一个简单的菜肴变得津津有味。\nGarlic\n大蒜\n\nIn my house, all I have to do is sauté garlic to draw hubby and the kids to my kitchen! Aside from tasting great, garlic has been touted as being able to help hair grow, cause acne to disappear and keep colds and flu at bay. Its antioxidant properties can help boost your immune system, and to get the most out of garlic's active chemical, allicin, cut a fresh clove up and expose it to the air for a little while before you cook with it.\n在家里，我只需要用油煎大蒜就可以把我的丈夫和孩子引到厨房来！大蒜除了味道好之外，还能促进头发生长，消除痤疮，预防感冒和流感。它的抗氧化特性可以帮助提高免疫系统。要充分获取大蒜里的活性化学物质――蒜素，可以先切一些新鲜的丁香，在空气中暴露一段时间后再一起烹饪。\nOnions\n洋葱\n\nChef Julia Child said, \"I cannot imagine a world without onions,\" and for good reason. The anti-inflammatory chemical in onions, called quercetin, can help ease discomfort from arthritis, and quercetin's beneficial properties have been associated with a lower risk of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and a stronger immune system.\n厨师朱莉亚・查尔德说，“我无法想象这个世界没有洋葱，”确实如此。洋葱里有一种抗炎化学物，叫做榭黄素，可以缓解关节炎引起的不适，它还能有效地降低癌症，心脏病，糖尿病的发病率，并提高人体的免疫系统。\nPotatoes\n土豆\n\nNearly all Americans fail to meet dietary recommendations for potassium (97 percent) or dietary fiber (95 percent). On an equal weight basis, the white potato provides as much fiber as and more potassium than other commonly consumed vegetables or fruit. A medium skin-on baked potato weighs in at just 163 calories, a whopping 941 milligrams of potassium and 3.6 grams of fiber. (A banana, also white in color, provides 422 milligrams of potassium and 3.1 grams of fiber.) Potatoes also provide vitamin C, vitamin B6 and magnesium, in addition to small amounts of high-quality protein.\n几乎所有的美国人都做不到饮食建议里说的钾含量达到97%或膳食纤维达到95%。在等重的情况下，白色马铃薯可以提供与普通蔬菜和水果等量的纤维，并且更多的钾元素。一个中等大小带皮的烤土豆仅包含163卡路里，但其中的钾含量却高达942毫克，纤维达3.6克。相比之下，香蕉只包含422毫克钾和3.1克纤维。土豆还富含维生素C，维生素B6和镁，此外还含有少量的高蛋白。"
