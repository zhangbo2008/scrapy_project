However, this is not always the best method for consistent savings.\nI always have my cheapest shop when I plan beforehand. Being organised is how I make sure I’m always getting the best deals; whether that’s using coupons, shopping the sales, checking for cheaper alternative products or ensuring I’m buying my groceries at the cheapest supermarket.\nThis additional time and effort may seem a lot more complex than just writing a simple shopping list but it really pays when you see how much you can save each week.\nAs an extreme couponer, my approach may differ from other savers, however, no matter how you approach saving, organisation is key. You should work out a system that works best for you and your family.\nTo help making a start on ensuring you are always getting your shopping for the best price, here are my top 10 tips for planning your supermarket shop.\n1. Create Your List\nI plan weekly with my mum. We write a full list which includes our daily plan, for all meals, which we then organise into two sections, essentials and luxuries. With a strict list, you won’t be tempted to buy more that you need.\n2. Check the Cupboards\nOne of the easiest ways to overspend is buying products you don’t need.\nSauces, condiments and basic products such as rice and pasta are the typical culprits for this. If you take the time to inspect what products you have in the house before leaving, you’ll only buy what you need and will instantly save before you’ve even stepped into the supermarket.\n3. Know Your Budget\nThe average household spends ￡56.80 per week on food, however if you strive to buy your shopping for less, the best advice is to know your budget. It is possible to get your shopping for less but you need to be flexible on the products and brands you buy to support savings.\n4. Comparison is Key\nThanks to the current supermarket ‘price war’, supermarket offers and product prices can change on a weekly, or even daily basis. Therefore, it is essential to check your shopping list on a comparison site, such as mysupermarket.co.uk. This ensures that you are always visiting the cheapest supermarket for your shop. This can change week on week, so be prepared to shop around if you want to save.\n5. Collecting Coupons\nOnce you have a shopping list, check for comparison coupons. The best places to look are brand websites and social media channels, in-store supermarket magazines and www.facebook.com/couponshopuk for a list of current supermarket coupons.\n6. Swap Shop\nIt’s not just comparing supermarkets that can save money. Always keep an eye out for alternative, cheaper products that you can swap. New products are launched daily and often are available with an introductory price or coupon, offering the perfect opportunity to try something new and save on your shopping.\n7. Time Your Shop\nIf you know your supermarket well, there will certainly be a preferred time to shop. This could be at the quietest time to ensure you get peace while you add up your shop or, as a must, a few hours before closing allowing you to shop in the reduced section. You may even find a comparison or alternative product that will bring down the cost of your shopping.\n8. Eat Before You Shop\nA member from Extreme Coupons UK advises eating before you shop. I too follow this rule and regardless whether it is proven or not, it certainly feels easier not to over fill your trolley when you have a full belly.\n9. Calculate as You Go\nAdd up your products as you put them into your trolley. This will ensure you are sticking to your set budget and that there are no nasty surprises at the till, you’ll know as soon as the final tally is in whether you’ve been overcharged anywhere too. This also acts as a perfect deterrent, if you add something that you don’t need and the cost starts to add up, it will be easier to place these products back onto the shelves.\n10. Claiming Cashback\nCashback sites are not for everyone as they only offer you savings after you have bought the products. However, if you are willing to make this extra effort they are great for getting money back and adding to the in store savings.\n 查看译文\n人人都希望每周看到自己的储蓄增长而不愿看到自己在超市购物方面超支。在你进店之前请记得做好准备。\n许多和我聊过的人说他们想开始在杂货店购物上省钱，并且因此立马减少销售，以此试图看到自己想要的结果。然而，对于长远的储蓄来说并不是的方法。\n当我事先准备好了，我总能花最少的钱购物。事先准备是说如何确保我总是以价格成交，是否可以使用优惠券、购物销售、寻找便宜的替代品或者确保我是在的超市购物。\n所需的这些额外时间和精力看起来比仅仅写一张购物清单要复杂得多，但是当你发现通过这种方法可以省不少钱你便会觉得一切都是值得的。\n为一个近乎极端的购物券支持者，我的方式可能和其他许多省钱者不同，然而，无论你省钱的方法如何，好好地组织便是关键。你应该找到适合你和你的家人的方法。\n为帮助你首先确保你每次都能以的价格购得商品，以下是超市购物计划的十大建议：\n1. 创建你自己的清单\n每周，我都和我妈一起商量计划。我们列出一整张清单，这包括我们的日常需求，对于一日三餐，我们分两部分列举：必需品和奢侈品。在清单的严格指导下，你永远不会买一些你用不着的东西。\n2.检查你的食橱\n买了自己不需要的商品最易导致超支。\n调味料、调味品以及日常必需品如大米和面食这些是典型的罪魁祸首。如果你在出门前你能够检查一下你已经有了的东西，那么你就会只买你需要的东西，这样便可以在你踏入超市之前便立即为你省下一笔钱。\n3.熟知你的预算\n每周花费在食物上的平均支出为56.8磅，然而如果你致力于减少购物开支，的建议是熟知你自己的预算。减少购物开支并无可能，只不过你需要灵活地对待你要购买的产品和品牌以省钱。\n4.货比三家是关键\n多亏了当今超市的“价格战”，价格每周甚至每天都可能会变动。因此，在比较网站如“我的超市购”核对你的购物清单很重要。这能够确保你总是能够去的超市购物。这可能每周都在变化，所以如果你想省钱的话，随时准备货比三家吧。\n5.收集购物券\n一旦你有了自己的购物清单，找到相对优惠的购物券。可以去这些地方寻找一系列的当前超市购物券：品牌网站、社会媒体渠道、超市内部杂志以及菲斯布克/购物券。\n6.以物易物商店\n不是只有货比三家可以省钱。时常擦亮眼睛那些可以以物易物的可选择的更便宜的产品。每天都有新产品出现，并且这些通常都伴随着试卖价和购物券，这给我们一个绝好的机会去尝试一些新的东西，并且在购物上省钱。\n7.制定好购物的时间\n如果你对那个超市了解的话，你肯定会有一个自己最喜欢的购物时间。这可能是在超市最安静的时间段，这样你就能从容地计算自己所购的商品总价，也可能是超市关门前几小时（强力推荐），这样你就能在减价区购物。你甚至可能找到和之前放入购物车的相类似或可替代的产品，从而减少购物支出。\n8.在购物前吃点东西\n来自“英国极端优惠券”的成员建议去商店前先吃点东西。我也同意这一点，无论它被证实与否，当你感觉饱的时候更不易过度购物。\n9.当你结账时计算你要付的账\n当你把东西放进购物车时请计算你要付的钱。这能够确保你在预算之内，并且，这会避免付账时意外尴尬的情形，在总账里你也可以知道你是否在哪里有超支。这也是一个完美的遏制，如果你买了自己不需要的东西花销便增加了，把这些产品放回货架将很容易。\n10.要求返还现金\n现金返还并不是适用于每个人，因为他们只在你在他们那里购物之后才提供。然而，如果你愿意去试试，这也是返得现金的好机会，并且可以节省店内花费。"
