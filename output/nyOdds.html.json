Wong Kim Ark, ruling that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a United States citizen, even though the parents were prohibited by the Chinese Exclusion Act from ever becoming citizens.\r\n\n最高法院确认了1898年在美国诉黄金德(United States v. Wong Kim Ark)案中达成的理解，裁定中国父母在旧金山生下的孩子是美国公民，即使《排华法案》禁止其父母成为公民。\r\n\n“To hold that the 14th Amendment of the Constitution excludes from citizenship the children, born in the United States, of citizens or subjects of other countries,” the court said, “would be to deny citizenship to thousands of persons of English, Scotch, Irish, German, or other European parentage who have always been considered and treated as citizens of the United States.”\r\n\n“如果宪法第14修正案将其他国家公民在美国所生的孩子排除在公民身份之外，”法院说，“这等于拒绝成千上万的英国人、苏格兰人、爱尔兰人、德国人或其他欧洲人，他们一直被视为美国公民，享受美国公民待遇。”\r\n\nJames C. Ho, a conservative legal scholar recently appointed by Mr. Trump to the federal appeals court in New Orleans, has written that the message of the decision is unmistakable. “This sweeping language reaches all aliens regardless of immigration status,” he wrote in 2006.\r\n\n最近由特朗普任命为新奥尔良联邦上诉法院法官的保守法律学者何俊宇(James C. Ho)写道，该决定的信息是明白无误的。“这种笼统的语言涵盖了所有外国人，无论其是否拥有移民身份，”他在2006年写道。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nThe 1898 decision did not specifically discuss unauthorized immigrants. But in 1982, in Plyler v. Doe, the Supreme Court ruled that undocumented children were entitled to free public education. The court relied on another part of the 14th amendment, its equal protection clause, and it interpreted language similar to that in the citizenship clause.\r\n\n1898年的判决没有具体讨论未获允许的移民。但在1982年，在普莱勒诉无名氏(Plyler v.Doe)案中，最高法院裁定无身份证明儿童有权享受免费公共教育。法院的裁判是依据第14修正案的另一部分，即平等保护条款；它的解释语言与公民身份条款的语言相类似。\r\n\n“Although the court splintered over the specific question of public education,” Mr. Ho wrote, “all nine justices agreed that the Equal Protection Clause protects legal and illegal aliens alike. And all nine reached that conclusion precisely because illegal aliens are ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the U.S., no less than legal aliens and U.S. citizens.”\r\n\n“尽管法院在公共教育的具体问题上存在分歧，”何俊宇写道，“但所有九名大法官都同意，平等保护条款保护合法和非法的外国人。所有九个人都得出了这个结论，正是因为非法的外国人同合法的外国人与美国公民一样‘受到美国司法管辖’。”\r\n\nIn asides in later decisions, too, the Supreme Court has assumed that the children of unauthorized immigrants born in the United States are citizens.\r\n\n在后来的裁决中，最高法院也曾顺带提到，在美国出生的无证移民子女是美国公民。\r\n\nTwo of Mr. Trump’s appointees sit on the Supreme Court, and it is more conservative than it has been in decades. But there is little reason to think a majority of the justices would be inclined to adopt Mr. Trump’s understanding of the 14th Amendment, as the constitutionality of birthright citizenship is not an issue that tends to divide lawyers along ideological lines.\r\n\n最高法院现有两名特朗普提名的大法官，形成数十年来最为保守的最高法院阵容。但几乎没有理由认为，多数法官会倾向于采纳特朗普对第14修正案的理解，因为律师不会因意识形态立场不同而在出生公民权的合宪性问题上产生对立。\r\n\n“According to the best reading of its text, structure and history, anyone born on American territory, no matter their national origin, ethnicity or station in life, is an American citizen,” John Yoo, who served in the George W. Bush administration and is now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote last week.\r\n\n“根据对文本、结构和历史的最佳解读，只要出生于美国领土，无论其国籍、种族或身份，都是美国公民，”曾在小布什(George W. Bush)政府任职、现为加州大学伯克利分校法学教授的柳约翰(John Yoo)上周写道。\r\n\n“The 14th Amendment settled the question of birthright citizenship,” Professor Yoo wrote. “Conservatives should not be the ones seeking a new law or even a constitutional amendment to reverse centuries of American tradition.”\r\n\n“第14修正案解决了出生公民权的问题，”柳约翰写道。“寻求一部新法律甚至宪法修正案来逆转数个世纪来的美国传统，不应该是保守派做的事情。”\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nA few prominent scholars have dissented, notably Peter H. Schuck, an emeritus professor at Yale Law School. “The argument against any birthright citizenship is that these children are here as a result of an illegal act and thus have no claim to membership in a country built on the ideal of mutual consent,” he wrote in 2010.\r\n\n一些著名学者对此表达了异议，尤其是耶鲁大学法学院荣休教授彼得·H·舒克(Peter H. Schuck)。“反对出生公民权的理由是，这些孩子在这里是违法行为的结果，因此在一个基于双方同意为目标的国家里，他们无权要求成为公民，”他在2010年写道。\r\n\nMr. Trump did not say whether his executive order would attempt to apply his understanding of the 14th Amendment retroactively. Revoking citizenship, the Supreme Court has said, poses special concerns.\r\n\n特朗普没有说他的行政命令是否会尝试让其对第14修正案的理解具有追溯适用效力。最高法院已经表示，取消公民身份会带来特殊的问题。\r\n\n“The very nature of our free government makes it completely incongruous to have a rule of law under which a group of citizens temporarily in office can deprive another group of citizens of their citizenship,” the court said in Afroyim v. Rusk, a 1967 decision that struck down a federal law canceling the citizenship of people who voted in foreign elections.\r\n\n“基于我们自由政府的本质，一群短暂执政的公民剥夺另一群公民身份的做法，是完全不符合法治精神的，”最高法院在阿弗罗伊姆诉鲁斯克(Afroyim v. Rusk)一案中说。1967年的这项判决推翻了一项联邦法律，该法律要取消在国外选举中投过票的人的公民身份。\r\n\n“We hold that the 14th Amendment was designed to, and does, protect every citizen of this nation against a congressional forcible destruction of his citizenship, whatever his creed, color, or race,” the court said. “Our holding does no more than to give to this citizen that which is his own, a constitutional right to remain a citizen in a free country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship.”\r\n\n“我们认为，第14修正案的目的是——而且确实是——保护这个国家的每个公民不被国会强制取消公民身份，无论其信仰、肤色、种族为何，”最高法院说。“我们的裁决不过是给予这名公民留在一个自由国家的宪法权利，除非其自愿放弃公民身份。”\r\n\nThere may be good policy arguments for doing away with birthright citizenship, but most legal scholars say it would take a constitutional amendment to do so. In his 1995 testimony, Mr. Dellinger said that a federal statute would not do, meaning that the executive order discussed by Mr. Trump would certainly not suffice.\r\n\n废除出生公民权或许有好的政策论据，但大多数法律学者都认为，需要通过宪法修正案才能做到这一点。在1995年的证词中，德林杰说，联邦法规是不够的，这意味着特朗普所说的行政命令是满足不了要求的。\r\n\n“Because the rule of citizenship acquired by birth within the United States is the law of the Constitution, it cannot be changed through legislation, but only by amending the Constitution,” he said.\r\n\n“由于在美国出生获得公民身份是宪法规定的，所以它不可能通过立法来改变，而只能通过修宪来完成，”他说。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\nHe added that history has lessons to teach. “From our experience with Dred Scott,” Mr. Dellinger said, “we had learned that our country should never again trust to judges or politicians the power to deprive from a class born on our soil the right of citizenship.”\r\n\n他还补充说，历史上有过经验教训。“从我们在德雷德·斯科特(Dred Scott)一案的经验，”德林杰说，“我们认识到，我们的国家再也不应该相信法官或者政客有权剥夺生于这片土地上的人获得公民身份的权利。”\r\n\n欢迎在Twitter上关注本文作者Adam Liptak @adamliptak。\r\n\n翻译：晋其角、杜然\r\n"
