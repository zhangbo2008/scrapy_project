Mrs. Obama denounces President Trump for his sexism and misogyny and, most forcefully, for his part in promoting the “birther” conspiracy theory that questioned Barack Obama’s citizenship.\r\n\n但她并没有完全退缩。奥巴马夫人谴责特朗普总统的性别歧视和厌恶女性，并且以最有力的笔触谴责他推动阴谋，质疑贝拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)公民身份的“出生地问题”中所起到的作用。\r\n\nShe described his campaign to discredit her husband as “crazy and meanspirited, of course, its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed,” as well as dangerous. “Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family’s safety at risk. And for this I’d never forgive him.”\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r她描述特朗普诋毁她丈夫的活动“疯狂而卑鄙，当然，其潜在的偏见和仇外心理几乎是赤裸裸的”，而且这些活动非常危险。“唐纳德·特朗普那些大声而鲁莽的影射危及到我家人的安全。为此，我永远不会原谅他。”\r\n\n“Becoming,” which is due out Nov. 13, from Crown, is shaping up to be one of the year’s biggest blockbusters, with a global first printing of 3 million copies, and a worldwide release in 31 languages.\r\n\n《成为》于11月13日由皇冠(Crown)出版社发布，将成为年度最轰动的畅销书之一，全球首印300万册，以31种语言发行。\r\n\n\r\nThe memoir is landing at a moment when the former president and first lady have returned to public life after mostly lying low in the months following the 2016 election. Mr. Obama campaigned energetically for Democratic candidates in the midterms, and Mrs. Obama has launched a new education project for adolescent girls and an initiative to promote voter registration and turnout. Now, she is about to travel the country on a 10-city book tour organized by Live Nation, the world’s largest concert promoter. At promotional events in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and elsewhere, Mrs. Obama will appear at sports stadiums with high profile moderators like Oprah Winfrey, Sarah Jessica Parker, Reese Witherspoon and Valerie Jarrett. (In some venues, front row seats with a “meet and greet” package are priced at $3,000; 10 percent of the tickets in each city are being given away to local charities, schools, and community groups.)\r\n\n这本回忆录发行之时，正值前总统和第一夫人重返公众生活，2016年大选后，他们一直保持低调。奥巴马在中期选举中积极为民主党候选人奔走，奥巴马夫人为青春期女孩发起了一个新的教育项目，并提出了一项促进选民登记和投票的倡议。现在，她即将在全美10个城市为她的书做巡回宣传，活动由全球最大的音乐会主办者莱恩娱乐(Live Nation)组织。在纽约、芝加哥、洛杉矶、波士顿和其他地方的宣传活动中，奥巴马夫人将出现在体育场馆，与奥普拉·温弗瑞(Oprah Winfrey)、莎拉·杰西卡·帕克(Jessica Parker)，瑞茜·威瑟斯彭(Reese Witherspoon)和瓦莱丽·贾勒特(Valerie Jarrett)等著名主持人一起出场。（在一些活动中，包含与奥巴马夫人“会面和打招呼”的前排作为套餐售价为3000美元；每个城市10%的门票将被赠送给当地的慈善机构、学校和社区团体。）\r\n\n\r\nWith the publication of “Becoming,” the Obamas now seem set to make their mark not just in politics, but in popular culture. Last year, they announced a joint book deal with Penguin Random House that was rumored to exceed $60 million, a large portion of which is going to their foundation and other charities. This year, they signed a multiyear production deal with Netflix, to produce films and television shows through their company, “Higher Ground Productions.” (They recently acquired screen rights to Michael Lewis’s new book, “The Fifth Risk,” for their company.)\r\n\n随着《成为》的出版，奥巴马夫妇现在似乎不仅要在政治上，而且要在流行文化中留下自己的印记。去年，他们宣布与企鹅兰登书屋(Penguin Random House)签订出书合同，传闻协议价值超过6000万美元，其中很大一部分将捐赠给他们的基金会和其他慈善机构。今年，他们与Netflix签订了一项为期数年的制片协议，通过他们的公司“高地制片”(Higher Ground Productions)拍摄电影和电视节目。（他们最近为该公司获得了迈克尔·刘易斯[Michael Lewis]的新书《第五风险》[The Fifth Risk]的版权。）\r\n\n“Becoming,” which The New York Times received a copy of, is in many ways a fairly conventional first lady’s memoir: An insider’s view of what it was like to live through national tragedies and other major events, in one of the most high-profile positions in the world. She describes the highs and lows of her husband’s eight years in office, like learning the gutting news of the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Conn., and how her husband summoned her to his side for comfort, something he rarely did during work hours, and the moment he told her that the mission to kill Osama bin Laden was successful.\r\n\n《纽约时报》收到了《成为》的样书，它是一本相当传统的第一夫人回忆录：一个身居世界上最高位置之一的内部人士，对经历国家悲剧和其他重大事件的感受。她描述了丈夫执政八年期间的高潮和低谷，比如得知康涅狄格州新镇桑迪胡克大屠杀的消息，以及她丈夫如何叫她来他身边，向她寻求安慰，他在工作时间很少这样做，还有他告诉她杀死奥萨马·本·拉登(Osama bin Laden)的任务成功的时候。\r\n\nBut as the first African-American first lady, Mrs. Obama’s experience was far from typical, and she writes about feeling greater scrutiny than her predecessors.\r\n\n但作为第一位非裔美国人第一夫人，奥巴马夫人的经历远非典型，她写了比她的前辈遭受更多审视时的感受。\r\n\n“I was humbled and excited to be first lady, but not for one second did I think I’d be sliding into some glamorous, easy role,” she writes. “Nobody who has the words ‘first’ and ‘black’ attached to them ever would.”\r\n\n“能成为第一夫人，我感到谦卑和兴奋，但我从没有一秒钟认为自己可以自动成为什么迷人、轻松的角色，”她写道。“任何同‘第一’和‘黑’沾边的人都做不到。”\r\n\nShe describes wanting to protect her daughters from the glare of public life, and recounts her difficulties becoming pregnant and suffering a miscarriage. She reveals, for the first time, that Malia and Sasha were conceived through in vitro fertilization, and describes feeling resentful about administering shots to herself while her husband was away at his job in the state legislature: “None of this was his fault, but it wasn’t equal, either,” she writes.\r\n\n她描述自己多么希望保护女儿们免受公共生活的刺激，并回忆自己怀孕和流产时的困难。她第一次透露，玛丽娅(Malia)和萨莎(Sasha)是通过体外受精怀孕的，她还提到因为要自己给自己注射而感到不满，当时丈夫正在州议会工作：“这一切都不是他的错，但这并不平等，”她写道。\r\n\n\r\n“看到现任总统的行为和政治议程导致许多美国人怀疑自己、彼此怀疑、彼此惧怕，这令人痛苦，”米歇尔·奥巴马在新书《成为》中写道。\n\r\nDespite some revealing passages and an intimate tone (she details her early courtship with Mr. Obama, describing a rush of “lust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder”), Mrs. Obama, not surprisingly, doesn’t let her guard down entirely, a protective posture that is consistent with her public persona.\r\n\n尽管有一些真情流露的段落和亲密的语气（她详细描述了她和奥巴马早年的恋爱，描述了两人之间“欲望、感恩、满足、奇迹”的冲动），但毫不令人奇怪的是，奥巴马夫人并没有彻底放下戒备，始终维持着一种同她的公众形象一致的保护姿态。\r\n\nToward the end of the book, Mrs. Obama takes aim at Mr. Trump, denouncing his policies and tenor in sweeping terms.\r\n\n在本书的最后，奥巴马夫人瞄准特朗普开火，全面谴责他的政策和态度。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\r\n“I’ve lain awake at night, fuming over what’s come to pass. It’s been distressing to see how the behavior and the political agenda of the current president have caused many Americans to doubt themselves and to doubt and fear one another,” she writes. “I sometimes wonder where the bottom might be.”\r\n\n“我在晚上无法入睡，对发生的事情感到愤怒。看到现任总统的行为和政治议程导致许多美国人怀疑自己、彼此怀疑、彼此惧怕，这令人痛苦，“她写道。“我有时在想，这到底什么时候是个头。”\r\n\nAfter The Washington Post and other outlets published stories about the book’s content, Mr. Trump responded on Friday. “She got paid a lot of money to write a book and they always expect a little controversy,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ll give you a little controversy back, I’ll never forgive [President Barack Obama] for what he did to our U.S. military. It was depleted, and I had to fix it,” Trump said. “What he did to our military made this country very unsafe for you and you and you.”\r\n\n《华盛顿邮报》(The Washington Post)和其他媒体发布有关该书内容的报道后，特朗普于周五作出了回应。“她拿了很多钱来写一本书，人们总是期待会有一点争议，”他说。“我也来给你一点争议，我永远不会原谅他（贝拉克·奥巴马总统）对我们美国军队的所作所为。它被耗干了，我不得不修好它，”特朗普说。“他对我们的军队所做的事情，让这个国家对于你、对于你们所有人来说都非常不安全。”\r\n\nAs for the question that’s likely to come up repeatedly on her book tour, Mrs. Obama tries to put to rest speculation that she’s gearing up for a career in politics.\r\n\n至于在签售活动中可能会反复出现的那个问题，奥巴马夫人试图平息人们对她正在为投身政治做准备的猜测。\r\n\n“I’ve never been a fan of politics, and my experience over the last ten years has done little to change that,” she writes. “I continue to be put off by the nastiness.”\r\n\n“我从不热衷政治，过去十年来的经历几乎没有改变这一点，”她写道。“我依然反感它的肮脏。”\r\n\n\r\n翻译：晋其角\r\n"
