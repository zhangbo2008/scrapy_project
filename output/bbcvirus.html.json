" More than 30 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer’s disease – the most common form of dementia. Unfortunately, there is no cure, only drugs to ease the symptoms.\r\n\n\r\nHowever, my own research suggests a way to treat the disease. I have found the strongest evidence yet that the herpes virus is a cause of Alzheimer’s, suggesting that effective and safe antiviral drugs might be able to treat the disease. We might even be able to vaccinate our children against it.\r\n\n\r\nThe virus implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), is better known for causing cold sores. It infects most people in infancy and then remains dormant in the peripheral nervous system (the part of the nervous system that isn’t the brain and the spinal cord). Occasionally, if a person is stressed, the virus becomes activated and, in some people, it causes cold sores.\r\n\n\r\nHSV1 enters the brains of elderly people as their immune system declines with age\r\n\n\r\nWe discovered in 1991 that in many elderly people HSV1 is also present in the brain. And in 1997 we showed that it confers a strong risk of Alzheimer’s disease when present in the brain of people who have a specific gene known as APOE4.\r\n\n\r\nThe virus can become active in the brain, perhaps repeatedly, and this probably causes cumulative damage. The likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease is 12 times greater for APOE4 carriers who have HSV1 in the brain than for those with neither factor.\r\n\n\r\nLater, we and others found that HSV1 infection of cell cultures causes beta-amyloid and abnormal tau proteins to accumulate. An accumulation of these proteins in the brain is characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.\r\n\n\r\nWe believe that HSV1 is a major contributory factor for Alzheimer’s disease and that it enters the brains of elderly people as their immune system declines with age. It then establishes a latent (dormant) infection, from which it is reactivated by events such as stress, a reduced immune system and brain inflammation induced by infection by other microbes.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nReactivation leads to direct viral damage in infected cells and to viral-induced inflammation. We suggest that repeated activation causes cumulative damage, leading eventually to Alzheimer’s disease in people with the APOE4 gene.\r\n\n\r\nPresumably, in APOE4 carriers, Alzheimer’s disease develops in the brain because of greater HSV1-induced formation of toxic products, or less repair of damage.\r\n\n\r\nNew treatments?\r\n\n阿尔茨海默病（又称老年痴呆，译者注)是最常见的痴呆症，全球有超过3000万人患此病。不幸的是，该病目前无法治愈，只能依靠药物缓解症状。\n但我的研究找到了治疗方法。我发现了迄今为止最有力的证据，表明疱疹病毒是该病的病因之一，这说明安全有效的抗病毒药物可能能够治疗老年痴呆，甚至可以给孩子们接种疫苗来预防。\n造成老年痴呆的病毒，即单纯疱疹病毒1型（HSV1），通常被人们熟知的症状是唇疱疹。大多数人会在婴儿期受到感染，病毒随后在周围神经系统（脑神经和脊髓神经以外的神经系统）中保持休眠状态。有时如果压力大，病毒就会被激活，有些人就会出现唇疱疹。\n我们在1991年发现，许多老年人的大脑中也有HSV1病毒。在1997年又证明，脑中携带APOE4基因的人患有老年痴呆的可能性会更大。\n疱疹病毒有可能在大脑中活跃起来，还可能会反复活跃，从而不断累积损伤。脑内有HSV1病毒的APOE4基因携带者，患老年痴呆的几率是非病毒及基因携带者的12倍。\n后来，我们又和其他研究者发现，细胞感染HSV1病毒会导致β-淀粉样蛋白和异常的τ蛋白积累，而这些蛋白在大脑中积累就是老年痴呆的特征。\n\r\n                    压力可能会激活疱疹病毒，也许最终导致长期的脑损伤。\r\n                \n我们认为，HSV1病毒是老年痴呆的主要原因，它会随着老年人免疫系统逐渐衰退而进入大脑，之后潜伏脑中，处于休眠状态。当出现压力，免疫系统减弱，或是受其他微生物感染诱发脑炎时，被重新激活。\n病毒被激活会直接损伤受感染的细胞，诱发炎症。反复激活会累积损害，最终导致携带APOE4基因的人患上老年痴呆症。\n我们推测，APOE4基因携带者出现老年痴呆症是由于HSV1病毒引起的毒性物质较他人更多，或是损伤修复的比较少。\n数据表明，抗病毒药物可以用于治疗老年痴呆。主要的抗病毒药物是安全的，可以防止新病毒形成，从而控制病毒的损害。\n我们在早前的一项研究中发现，抗疱疹的抗病毒药物阿昔洛韦能够阻断HSV1病毒复制自身DNA，从而降低受HSV1病毒感染的细胞中β-淀粉样蛋白和τ蛋白的水平。\n值得注意的是，所有研究，包括我们的研究，只是说明疱疹病毒和老年痴呆有联系，但并不能证明疱疹病毒就是真正病因。证明微生物是不是病因，唯一的方法可能是使用特定的抗菌剂，或是接种针对性的疫苗，看看能否显著减少这种疾病。\n但令人兴奋的是，在台湾，已经有大规模样本的实验证明，使用特定的抗疱疹药物能够预防老年痴呆。希望其他国家/地区如果有这方面的实验，结果也是如此。\n\r\n\r\n \n More than 30 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer’s disease – the most common form of dementia.

The main antiviral agents, which are safe, prevent new viruses from forming, thereby limiting viral damage.\r\n\n\r\nIn an earlier study, we found that the anti-herpes antiviral drug, acyclovir, blocks HSV1 DNA replication, and reduces levels of beta-amyloid and tau caused by HSV1 infection of cell cultures.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s important to note that all studies, including our own, only show an association between the herpes virus and Alzheimer’s – they don’t prove that the virus is an actual cause. Probably the only way to prove that a microbe is a cause of a disease is to show that an occurrence of the disease is greatly reduced either by targeting the microbe with a specific anti-microbial agent or by specific vaccination against the microbe.\r\n\n\r\nExcitingly, successful prevention of Alzheimer’s disease by use of specific anti-herpes agents has now been demonstrated in a large-scale population study in Taiwan. Hopefully, information in other countries, if available, will yield similar results.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\n\n阿尔茨海默病（又称老年痴呆，译者注)是最常见的痴呆症，全球有超过3000万人患此病。不幸的是，该病目前无法治愈，只能依靠药物缓解症状。\n\r\n\n但我的研究找到了治疗方法。我发现了迄今为止最有力的证据，表明疱疹病毒是该病的病因之一，这说明安全有效的抗病毒药物可能能够治疗老年痴呆，甚至可以给孩子们接种疫苗来预防。\n造成老年痴呆的病毒，即单纯疱疹病毒1型（HSV1），通常被人们熟知的症状是唇疱疹。大多数人会在婴儿期受到感染，病毒随后在周围神经系统（脑神经和脊髓神经以外的神经系统）中保持休眠状态。有时如果压力大，病毒就会被激活，有些人就会出现唇疱疹。\n\r\n\n我们在1991年发现，许多老年人的大脑中也有HSV1病毒。在1997年又证明，脑中携带APOE4基因的人患有老年痴呆的可能性会更大。\n\r\n\n疱疹病毒有可能在大脑中活跃起来，还可能会反复活跃，从而不断累积损伤。脑内有HSV1病毒的APOE4基因携带者，患老年痴呆的几率是非病毒及基因携带者的12倍。\n后来，我们又和其他研究者发现，细胞感染HSV1病毒会导致β-淀粉样蛋白和异常的τ蛋白积累，而这些蛋白在大脑中积累就是老年痴呆的特征。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    压力可能会激活疱疹病毒，也许最终导致长期的脑损伤。\r\n                \n我们认为，HSV1病毒是老年痴呆的主要原因，它会随着老年人免疫系统逐渐衰退而进入大脑，之后潜伏脑中，处于休眠状态。当出现压力，免疫系统减弱，或是受其他微生物感染诱发脑炎时，被重新激活。\n病毒被激活会直接损伤受感染的细胞，诱发炎症。反复激活会累积损害，最终导致携带APOE4基因的人患上老年痴呆症。\n我们推测，APOE4基因携带者出现老年痴呆症是由于HSV1病毒引起的毒性物质较他人更多，或是损伤修复的比较少。\n新疗法？\n数据表明，抗病毒药物可以用于治疗老年痴呆。主要的抗病毒药物是安全的，可以防止新病毒形成，从而控制病毒的损害。\n我们在早前的一项研究中发现，抗疱疹的抗病毒药物阿昔洛韦能够阻断HSV1病毒复制自身DNA，从而降低受HSV1病毒感染的细胞中β-淀粉样蛋白和τ蛋白的水平。\n\r\n\n值得注意的是，所有研究，包括我们的研究，只是说明疱疹病毒和老年痴呆有联系，但并不能证明疱疹病毒就是真正病因。证明微生物是不是病因，唯一的方法可能是使用特定的抗菌剂，或是接种针对性的疫苗，看看能否显著减少这种疾病。\n但令人兴奋的是，在台湾，已经有大规模样本的实验证明，使用特定的抗疱疹药物能够预防老年痴呆。希望其他国家/地区如果有这方面的实验，结果也是如此。\n\r\n\r\n"
