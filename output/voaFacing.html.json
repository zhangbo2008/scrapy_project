2017 have largely given him a pass, declining to hold hearings that might reflect badly on him or the officials he has

of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics,\" said the election results show \"the American people have demanded accountability from their government and sent a clear message of what they want from Congress.\"\r\n\n\r\n纳德勒说，特朗普“可能不会高兴，但是他和他的政府将需要对法律和美国人民负责”。\r\n\nNadler said Trump \"may not like it, but he and his administration will be held accountable to our laws and to the American
