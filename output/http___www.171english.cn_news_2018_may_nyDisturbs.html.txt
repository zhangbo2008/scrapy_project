"Bedtime reading with a tablet or smartphone can interfere with a good night’s sleep, some studies and many anecdotal reports suggest. Now researchers have conducted a small experiment to test the idea.\r\n\r\n一些研究和个案报告表明，使用平板电脑或手机进行睡前阅读可能会影响睡眠质量。研究人员进行了一个小实验来验证这一说法。\r\n\r\nScientists had nine people spend 10 nights in a sleep laboratory. For five consecutive nights, they read before sleep with an iPad; then they read print for five nights. In both scenarios, they read in a dimly lit room until they felt ready to go to sleep.\r\n\r\n科学家让九人在睡眠实验室中度过了10个晚上。他们将连续五个夜晚使用iPad进行睡前阅读，接下来的五个夜晚，他们会阅读印刷品。两种情况下，他们都会在光线昏暗的房间里阅读，直到他们感觉已准备好入睡。\r\n\r\n"
