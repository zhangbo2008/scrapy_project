It was also the perfect foil for her son’s all-cream and white ensemble.\nThe Duchess clearly continues to be strongly influenced by Diana. The outfit was almost identical to the red skirt suit Diana wore in October 1989 to visit RAF Wittering - from the vivid shade right down to the the buttons, pointy collar and sharp shoulders.\nAt the height of her fame, the reticent, late Chelsea-based couturier Catherine Walker was synonymous with Diana’s glamorous dresses. She made over 1,000 outfits for her Royal client; the first three months after her wedding to Charles and the last a little black dress ordered a few weeks before she died; Diana was buried in it.\nSome of them C such as the white ‘Elvis’ dress, pearl-studded with a bolero jacket C were among Diana’s most memorable and showstopping looks.\nKate has become the darling of the world's media in much the same way as Princess Diana did, and echoes her chic style 30 years later in a very similar outfit. She was wearing Catherine Walker, favoured by Diana.\nLate Chelsea-based couturier Catherine Walker was synonymous with Diana’s glamorous dresses, including these piece. She made over 1,000 outfits for her Royal client, even the little black dress she was buried in.\nShe wore a Walker smock to leave hospital with baby Prince William, and Walker gowns C one white silk, another with a black halter neck - when she was photographed by Mario Testino for Vanity Fair in 1997.\nWalker’s particular talent - and one which will appeal to Kate as much as it did Diana - was for making outfits that showed off the woman rather than the frock. They were dignifed yet - particularly post Charles and Diana’s divorce - more than a little daring.\nHer clothes are statements of style rather than fashion, and the fabric and cut are always perfect.\nSo it shouldn’t have been that much of a surprise when Carole Middleton chose the fashion house, run since Catherine’s death in 2010 by her second husband and business partner, Sayeed Ismail, to make her triumphant pale blue coat and dress for the Royal Wedding.\nThe House of Walker clearly won Middleton loyalty on that day. Carole wore Catherine Walker again to George’s christening.\nIt wasn’t long before Kate turned to Walker too, choosing the label to make two stunning outfits for her first official trip to Canada.\nOne, a grey wool pencil dress, was particularly striking, showing off Kate’s slender post-wedding figure to perfection.\nHowever, this week’s outfit won’t win as many fashion plaudits. It looked more Virgin air hostess than royal style icon - add a slash of red lipstick and a jauntily-tied scarf and she’d be offering you a glass of champagne before take-off.\nDiana isn’t the only royal from whom Kate is taking style inspiration. She is also wearing the Queen’s diamond fern brooch, a gift from the Women of Auckland in 1954 and what appear to be American tan tights. Hands full: Kate was carrying baby George and holding onto the railing of the plane's stairs at the same time\nHowever, where were the hemline weights which preserve Her Majesty modesty on even the most blustery days? Instead, Kate’s fabulous thighs had another airing as she walked down the aeroplane steps, which sadly detracted from what could have otherwise been a polished look.\nThe Gina Foster pillbox hat, too C a little bit Jackie O, but a lot more Queen Mum C marks her out as one of the family, part of the Royal lineage, mother and wife to heirs to the throne. Her ￡400 shoes from London boutique Emmy (with a matching ￡200 clutch) make a welcome change from those nude LK Bennet heels she’s so attached to, and lengthen her already fabulous legs.\nHer red coat and dress also showcased her neat waist and slender limbs beautifully.\nKate clearly knows - just as her late mother-in-law did - that a Catherine Walker ensemble shows a woman’s figure off to its best advantage.\n 查看译文\n剑桥公爵夫人抵达澳大利亚，穿着引人注目的凯瑟琳・沃克品牌外套和裙子，虽然衣裙都比平常穿的更长，但一阵狂风仍然害她曝光了。\n相比平常，下图这套服装的下摆长了约三英寸（7.62cm）。似乎凯特还没把女王的着装技巧用于自己的服装。\n凯特刚下飞机，就向人们闪现了有型的大腿。\n玛丽莲・梦露时刻：剑桥公爵夫人、威廉王子和婴儿乔治4月7日抵达新西兰惠灵顿。刚下飞机，公爵夫人差点就全曝光。\n上图是2011年凯特在加拿大，当时她偏爱短裙，起风时，裙子被掀起来了。\n沃克是已逝王妃戴安娜最喜欢的设计师。为了凯特的第一次正式出访，他特地设计了有两排珍珠纽扣的红色大衣。\n这款衣服颜色和款式都引人注目，确保凯特在惠灵顿刮大风的阴天里脱颖而出，还完美地衬托出她儿子全套奶油白的服装。\n显然公爵夫人仍深受戴安娜王妃的影响。她穿的那套衣服几乎和1989年10月戴安娜参观皇家空军Wittering时穿的红色西服裙一模一样，不论是鲜艳的颜色，还是纽扣、尖的衣领或棱角分明的肩膀。\n在凯瑟琳・沃克名声远扬之时，这位沉默不语、住在切尔西的女装设计师就是戴安娜华裙美服的同义词，如今她已去世。她为戴安娜王妃做了1000多套服装：第一件是戴安娜与查尔斯结婚六月后做的，最后一件是戴安娜死前几周定制的黑色礼服，戴安娜穿着它下葬。\n有些设计――比方说镶有珍珠的白色“埃尔维斯”裙，配上开襟女式短上衣――是戴安娜最让人难以忘怀最精彩夺目的样子。\n凯特就如戴安娜王妃一样，成为世界媒体的宠儿，她的衣着和戴安娜的相似，让人联想起30年前戴安娜的新潮款式。凯特也穿着戴安娜最喜欢的设计师凯瑟琳・沃克设计的衣服。\n曾住在切尔西的已故女装设计师凯瑟琳・沃克是戴安娜华裙美服的同义词。其中包括上面的设计。她为戴安娜王妃做了1000多套衣服，甚至还包括戴安娜穿着下葬的小黑裙。\n她穿着沃克设计的宽身长衫，抱着还是婴儿的威廉王子离开医院。1997年，她让《名利场》的马里奥・特斯蒂诺给她拍照时，穿的白丝礼服和黑色露背礼服都是沃克设计的。\n沃克的特殊才能――同时深深地吸引了戴安娜王妃和凯特王妃――是她做出的衣服显示的是女性而不是服装。戴安娜的服装虽然有点大胆，却不失高贵――即使是和查尔斯离婚后。\n她的服装展示的是风格而不是时尚，无论是质地还是剪裁都是一流的。\n2010年凯瑟琳去世后，她的第二任丈夫和商业伙伴赛义德・伊斯梅尔继续经营她的时装店。卡罗尔・米德尔特（凯特的母亲）选择凯瑟琳的时装店为参加凯特和威廉的皇室婚礼制作浅蓝色的衣裙，也是情理之中。\n显然就在皇室婚礼那天，沃克的服装店赢得了米德尔顿的忠诚。乔治接受洗礼的那天，卡罗尔又穿着凯瑟琳・沃克的服装。\n不久以后凯特也爱上了沃克品牌，首次去加拿大时，就选择这个牌子，为自己做了两套令人赞不绝口的衣服。\n其中一套是羊毛做的灰色铅笔裙，尤为显著，尽显凯特婚后的苗条身姿。\n然而这周的服装不会赢得时尚界太多的喝彩，看起来更像是空中处女而不是皇家风格的标志，加上一线红色口红和时髦的围巾，她就是起飞前给你送来一杯香槟的空中小姐。\n凯特着装的灵感不仅来自戴安娜这一个皇室成员，她还带着女王的钻石蕨形胸针，1954年女王出访奥克兰时，获得的礼物。这个胸针看起来像美国铜色的紧身衣。\n在刮大风的日子里，那些能维持凯特王妃风范的下摆去哪了？凯特走下飞机时的秀腿让人们分了心，不曾注意到她的优雅，真是让人伤心。\n还有那顶吉娜・福斯特设计的圆盒帽――有点女歌手杰姬・O的味道，但更多的是像女王妈妈，把她看做是家庭的一员、皇室血统的一部分、王位继承人的母亲和妻子。她穿着伦敦精品艾美店的鞋子，价值400英镑（配有200英镑的手提包），而不是她迷恋不已的LK Bennet高跟鞋，这一改变受到大众的欢迎，让她的美腿显得更修长。\n凯特的红色衣裙也完美地展现了她的细腰和苗条的四肢。\n显然凯特知道――就如她已逝的岳母一样――凯瑟琳・沃克品牌能程度地显示出女性的优美身材。"
