She sent the fish’s measurements to the International Game Fish Association to recognize her as the new world record holder for a pacific bluefin tuna catch, and she's still waiting for the official word.\n　　2月19日，唐娜在自己的“斗士号”船上捕到了这条重达411.6公斤的太平洋蓝鳍金枪鱼。唐娜已经向国际渔猎协会申报了这条鱼的尺寸，她还在等待官方确认“世界之最”的消息。\n　　\"I hooked up at 9:10 a.m. with the reel screaming,\" Pascoe told the Saltwater Sportsman. \"The fish never surfaced, so we had no idea what was on the other end. After three hours, the fish surfaced and the skipper yelled 'Tuna, world record!'\"\n　　唐娜表示，“我是在早上9点10分的时候钓到这条大鱼的。起先它一直没有浮出水面，我们也不知道钓到的到底是什么。经过了3个小时，这条大鱼慢慢浮出水面，我们都大叫道‘是金枪鱼，破世界纪录级别的大鱼!’”\n　　At 411.6kg, the fish weighs twice as much as a baby elephant and could fill 3162 cans of tuna.\n　　这条金枪鱼重约411.6公斤，体重约为一头小象的两倍，可以做成3162个金枪鱼罐头。\n　　Alistair Blair, chairman of The Fish Society, the largest online fish retailer in Britain, told MailOnline: 'The wholesale value of a bluefin tuna that size would be in the realm of $8,300 to $16,500 - that's about four times the value of an ordinary tuna. The retail value, of course, would be much higher - somewhere around $83,000 or more.'\n　　渔协主席、英国的在线渔业零售商阿利斯泰尔-布莱尔表示，“这条金枪鱼的批发价可以达到8300美元到16500美元，是普通金枪鱼的4倍。如果是零售的话，就会更贵了，差不多可以达到83000美元或更多。”\n　　Last year, however, a 222kg bluefin tuna sold for $1.09 million at a Tokyo auction. By that standard, Donna's fish could be worth up to $2 million at auction.\n　　去年在东京的拍卖会上，一条重达222公斤的金枪鱼拍出了109万美元的高价。如果按照这个标准来看，唐娜的这条大鱼价值至少超过200万美元。\n　　Donna, however, is unable to sell it because the fish wasn't caught on a commercial vessel. Instead, she plans to have it mounted by a taxidermist at the Houhora Big Game & Sports Fishing Club in New Zealand.\n　　但是唐娜不能卖掉这条金枪鱼，因为她不是在商业渔船上捕到的这条鱼。因此，她决定将其做成动物标本放在新西兰的一家俱乐部里。\n　　Donna explained: 'We were originally going to have it smoked and shared around our friends, but then we were talked out of this as it was so monumental.'\n　　唐娜解释说，“我们原本是打算把这条鱼烤来吃，和我们的朋友一起分享它的美味的。但是，我们觉得这实在太有纪念意义了(所以决定把它做成标本)。”"
