"Thank you very much for that warm welcome.\nYou'll have to excuse me if I cough during this speech; I've been up all night supergluing the backdrop.\nThere are some things about last year's conference I have tried to forget. But I will always remember the warmth I felt from everyone in the hall. You supported me all the way - thank you.\nThis year marks a century since the end of the First World War.\nJust a few hundred yards from this conference centre stands a Hall of Memory, built to honour the sacrifice of men and women from this city in that terrible conflict.\nInscribed within it are some familiar words:\n\"At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember them.\"\nWe do remember them.\nWe remember the young men who left their homes to fight and die in the mud and horror of the trenches.\nWe remember the sailors who shovelled coal into hellfire furnaces in the bowels of battleships.\nWe remember the selflessness of a remarkable generation, whose legacy is the freedom we enjoy today.\nI think of Hubert Grant - my father's cousin in whose honour he was named. Hubert fought and died at Passchendaele at the age of just 19.\nLast year, at the service to mark the centenary of that battle, I took a moment to find his name on the Menin Gate, alongside thousands of his comrades.\nWe will remember them.\nBut the builders of that Hall of Memory also wanted us to do something else. Alongside a commitment to remember, they inscribed a command that still calls to us today:\n\"See to it that they shall not have suffered and died in vain.\"\nThose words express a determination that transformed our country. A determination that the men who returned from the quagmires of Passchendaele to their families, here in Birmingham and across the land, should have homes fit for heroes.\nThat the women who made munitions, kept the buses and trains running, served as firefighters and police officers, should have a voice in our democracy.\nThat a country which stood together in solidarity, with people of every class sharing the danger, should become a fairer place.\nA generation later, another victory built on shared sacrifice renewed that determination.\nTwice in a century, Britain came together to beat the odds and build a better future.\nA stronger democracy in the Mother of Parliaments - where every person, no matter their gender, no matter their class, has an equal voice.\nA fairer economy in the home of the free market - where enterprise creates wealth to fund great public services.\nA more secure future in the post-war world - where former enemies become friends and the trans-Atlantic alliance makes our world a safer place.\nWe must recapture that spirit of common purpose.\nBecause the lesson of that remarkable generation is clear: if we come together, there is no limit to what we can achieve. Our future is in our hands. And that is why we are all in this hall today. It is the reason we chose to get involved in politics in the first place.\nWe believe that by standing up to be counted, by working together, we can change our communities and our country for the better.\nIt's not always glamorous.\nI've seen the trailers for 'Bodyguard' and let me tell you - it wasn't like that in my day.\nReal politics involves a lot of hard graft. Knocking on doors in all weathers. Delivering bundles of leaflets. We do it because we believe in its potential to transform lives.\nWe understood when we got involved that sometimes it's adversarial. But in the last few years something's changed for the worse. I feel it. I am sure you do too.\nRigorous debate between political opponents is becoming more like a confrontation between enemies. People who put themselves forward to serve are becoming targets. Not just them, their families as well.\nWe all saw the sickening pictures of a far-left extremist shouting abuse at Jacob Rees-Mogg's children.\nAnd it's not only Conservatives who are facing abuse.\nThe first black woman ever to be elected to the House of Commons receives more racist and misogynist messages today than when she first stood over 30 years ago.\nYou do not have to agree with a word Diane Abbott says to believe passionately in her right to say it, free from threats and abuse.\nSome people have lost sight of the fact that political differences are not everything.\nI have served in local and national government, in office and in opposition. I know that no party has a monopoly on good ideas. That getting things done requires working together - within parties and beyond them.\nWhen our politics becomes polarised, and compromise becomes a dirty word, that becomes harder.\nAnd good people are put off public service.\nIt doesn't have to be this way.\nOur party has more elected representatives than any other.\nWe have in our hands the power to set a standard of decency that will be an example for others to follow.\nJohn McCain, who spoke at this conference 12 years ago, put it like this: \"We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement.\"\nThat was Jo Cox's message too.\nIt is a truth that the British people instinctively understand. Because they are not ideologues.\nThey know we all have a common stake in this country and that the only path to a better future is one that we walk down together.\nSo, let's rise above the abuse.\nLet's make a positive case for our values that will cut through the bitterness and bile that is poisoning our politics.\nLet's say it loud and clear: Conservatives will always stand up for a politics that unites us rather than divides us.\nThat used to be Labour's position too. But when I look at its leadership today, I worry it's no longer the case.\nWe all remember what the Labour Party used to be. We passionately disagreed with many of their policies.\nEvery Labour Government left unemployment higher than they found it.\nEvery Labour Government ran out of other people's money to spend.\nEvery Labour Government left the economy in a mess.\nBut at least they had some basic qualities that everyone could respect. They were proud of our institutions. They were proud of our armed forces. They were proud of Britain.\nToday, when I look across at the opposition benches, I can still see that Labour Party.\nThe heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Dennis Healy and John Smith. But not on the front bench.\nInstead their faces stare blankly out from the rows behind, while another party occupies prime position: the Jeremy Corbyn Party.\nThe Jeremy Corbyn Party rejects the common values that once bridged our political divide.\nCompare Jeremy Corbyn's behaviour to that of his predecessors.\nWould Neil Kinnock, who stood-up to the hard-left, have stood by while his own MPs faced deselection, and needed police protection at their Party conference?\nWould Jim Callaghan, who served in the Royal Navy, have asked the Russian government to confirm the findings of our own intelligence agencies?\nWould Clement Attlee, Churchill's trusted deputy during the Second World War, have told British Jews they didn't know the meaning of anti-semitism?\nWhat has befallen Labour is a national tragedy.\nWhat has it come to when Jewish families today seriously discuss where they should go if Jeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister? When a leading Labour MP says his party is 'institutionally racist'? When the Leader of the Labour Party is happy to appear on Iranian state TV, but attacks our free media here in Britain?\nThat is what Jeremy Corbyn has done to the Labour Party. It is our duty, in this Conservative Party, to make sure he can never do it to our country.\nTo do that we need to be a Party for the whole country.\nBecause today millions of people, who have never supported our Party in the past, are appalled by what Jeremy Corbyn has done to Labour.\nThey want to support a party that is decent, moderate, and patriotic. One that puts the national interest first. Delivers on the issues they care about. And is comfortable with modern Britain in all its diversity.\nWe must show everyone in this country that we are that Party.\nA Party that conserves the best of our inheritance, but is not afraid of change. A party of patriotism, but not nationalism.\nA party that believes in business, but is not afraid to hold businesses to account.\nA party that believes in the good that government can do, but knows government will never have all the answers.\nA party that believes your success in life should not be defined by who you love, your faith, the colour of your skin, who your parents were, or where you were raised - but by your talent and your hard work.\nAbove all a party of Unionism, not just of four proud nations, but of all our people.\nA party not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best.\nAnd we must be a party that is not in thrall to ideology, but motivated instead by enduring principles.\nFor me they can be summed-up in three words: Security. Freedom. Opportunity.\nSecurity for the nation with strong defences against threats from abroad, and protection against threats at home. Security for communities, upheld by the brave men and women of our police forces. Security for individuals and families, provided by a good job, a home of your own, and dignity in old age. And security is the bedrock of freedom.\nFreedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of action. The freedom to make decisions for yourself, rather than have them made for you by government. The freedom that our grandparents and great grandparents fought for against tyranny. The freedom that swept across Eastern Europe when the Soviet Union collapsed, and nations were reborn in sovereignty and independence. The freedom that is still denied to many in our world today.\nBut with freedom should always come responsibility. To obey the law, even when you disagree with it. To conserve our environment, for the next generation.\nAnd most especially for those in public life - the responsibility to weigh the impact our words and actions have on other people.\nAnd if we are secure and we are free, then opportunity is opened-up.\nThe opportunity to take your future in your hands. To dream, and strive, and achieve a better life. To know that if your dad arrived on a plane from Pakistan, you can become Home Secretary. That if you spent time in care, you can be in the Cabinet. That if your grandparents came to our shores as part of the Windrush generation, you could be the next Mayor of London. That if you are pregnant with your first child and engaged to your girlfriend, you could be the next First Minister of Scotland.\nWe, the Conservative Party, are the party of opportunity.\nNo institution embodies our principles as Conservatives more profoundly or more personally than our National Health Service. It gives every man, woman and child the absolute security of knowing that whenever you are sick, care will be there.\nWhat greater freedom than to live your life never having to worry about whether you can afford the treatment you need? What greater opportunity for a country to make the most of all its talents?\nThe NHS is a service that is there for everyone; free at the point of use; with care based always on clinical need, never the ability to pay. These principles are in our country's DNA. And Conservatives will always uphold them.\nIndeed, Conservatives have looked after our NHS for most of its life. And this year we gave the NHS a seventieth birthday present to be proud of: the biggest cash boost in its history. An extra lb394 million every single week.\nAnd in return, the NHS will produce a new long-term plan to make sure every penny makes a difference on the front line. So, next time you hear someone say that the Tories don't care about the NHS, tell them about that extra funding.\nTell them about the Conservative MPs who work in the NHS in their spare time.\nTell them about the Tory Prime Minister who can only do her job thanks to the wonderful staff of her local NHS trust, who help her manage diabetes.\nTell them about our Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire. Last year James officially opened the new Guy's Cancer Centre at Queen Mary's Hospital in his constituency. A few months later he was a patient.\nThe outstanding NHS care he received helped him recover, and now he is back serving in the Cabinet.\nCancer can strike any of us at any time. A few years ago, my goddaughter was diagnosed with cancer. She underwent treatment and it seemed to be working. But then the cancer came back. Last summer, she sent me a text to tell me that she was hoping to see another Christmas. But she didn't make it.\nHalf of us will be diagnosed with cancer. All of us know someone who has been. Survival rates are increasing, but we are lagging behind other countries.\nSo today I can announce a new Cancer Strategy, funded through our 70th birthday investment, will form a central part of our long-term plan for the NHS.\nThe key to boosting your chance of surviving cancer is early diagnosis.\nFive-year survival rates for bowel cancer are over 90% if caught early, but less than 10% if diagnosed late.\nThrough our Cancer Strategy, we will increase the early detection rate from one-in-two today, to-three-in four by 2028.\nWe will do it by lowering the age at which we screen for bowel cancer from 60 to 50. By investing in the very latest scanners. And by building more Rapid Diagnostic Centres - one stop-shops that help people get treatment quicker.\nThis will be a step-change in how we diagnose cancer.\nIt will mean that by 2028, 55,000 more people will be alive five years after their diagnosis compared to today.\nEvery life saved means precious extra years with friends and family. Every life saved means a parent, a partner, a child, a god mother spared the pain of losing a loved one before their time.\nOur NHS saves countless lives every day. That is never more true than when our national security is threatened. Those are the times when I feel most keenly the responsibilities of my office.\nWhen I have to ask our brave servicemen and women to put themselves in harm's way. To protect our citizens. To support our allies, as we would expect them to support us. To uphold the international rules on which our security depends.\nLike when the Syrian regime attacked Douma with chemical weapons, killing innocent men, women and children. We joined with our friends to send a message that the use of chemical weapons will never be tolerated. I took the decision to send RAF jets to strike against Assad's chemical weapons facilities. As Prime Minister, I had to make the call, and then be held to account for it.\nThe same was true when Russia launched a chemical attack on the streets of the United Kingdom. I took the decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats who were undeclared intelligence officers. Our allies joined with us in degrading Russia's intelligence network.\nIn Parliament I received almost universal support - from the SNP to the Liberal Democrats and the Labour backbenches.\nThere was just one dissenting voice - Jeremy Corbyn. Dismissing the findings of our security services. Suggesting that the country responsible for the attack should double-check the findings of our chemical weapons scientists. Refusing to lay the blame squarely where it belonged. Just imagine if he were Prime Minister.\nHe says Britain should disarm herself in the hope others follow suit.\nI say no - we must keep our defences strong to keep our country safe.\nHe says a strong NATO simply provokes Russia.\nI say no - it is the guarantor of our freedom and security.\nHe poses as a humanitarian. But he says that military action to save lives is only justified with the approval of the Security Council - effectively giving Russia a veto.\nI say no - we cannot outsource our conscience to the Kremlin.\nLeadership is doing what you believe to be right and having the courage and determination to see it through. That is the approach I have taken on Brexit.\nWe have had disagreements in this Party about Britain's membership of the EU for a long time. So, it is no surprise that we have had a range of different views expressed this week.\nBut my job as Prime Minister is to do what I believe to be in the national interest. And that means two things.\nFirst, honouring the result of the referendum.\nMPs asked the British people to take this decision. We put our faith in their judgement. They have put their faith in us to deliver. I will not let them down.\nAnd secondly, to seek a good trading and security relationship with our neighbours after we have left. They are our close friends and allies, and we should ensure it stays that way. That's what I said at Lancaster House. It's what we promised in our manifesto. And it's what I've worked day and night for the last two years to achieve.\nNo-one wants a good deal more than me. But that has never meant getting a deal at any cost. Britain isn't afraid to leave with no deal if we have to.\nBut we need to be honest about it. Leaving without a deal - introducing tariffs and costly checks at the border - would be a bad outcome for the UK and the EU.\nIt would be tough at first, but the resilience and ingenuity of the British people would see us through. Some people ask me to rule out no deal. But if I did that I would weaken our negotiating position and have to agree to whatever the EU offers.\nAnd at the moment that would mean accepting one of two things.\nEither a deal that keeps us in the EU in all but name, keeps free movement, keeps vast annual payments and stops us signing trade deals with other countries.\nOr a deal that carves off Northern Ireland, a part of this country, effectively leaving it in the EU's Custom's Union.\nSo, let us send a clear message from this hall today: we will never accept either of those choices. We will not betray the result of the referendum. And we will never break up our country.\nI have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same.\nIn a negotiation, if you can't accept what the other side proposes, you present an alternative. That is what we have done.\nOur proposal is for a free trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods.\nIt would protect hundreds of thousands of jobs in the just-in-time supply chains our manufacturing firms rely on.\nBusinesses wouldn't face costly checks when they export to the EU, so they can invest with confidence.\nAnd it would protect our precious Union - the seamless border in Northern Ireland, a bedrock of peace and stability, would see no change whatsoever.\nNo simple free trade agreement could achieve that, not even one that makes use of the very latest technology.\nOur proposal would be good for our rural communities, getting us out of the Common Agricultural Policy.\nIt would be good for our coastal communities.\nWe would be out of the Common Fisheries Policy, an independent coastal state once again.\nAnd with the UK's biggest fishing fleets based in Scotland, let me say this to Nicola Sturgeon.\nYou claim to stand up for Scotland, but you want to lock Scottish fishermen into the CFP forever. That's not 'Stronger for Scotland', it's a betrayal of Scotland.\nOur proposal would mean we could renew our role in the world, strike new trade deals with other countries.\nWith control of our money, we can spend more on our NHS.\nWith control of our laws, we can bring decision-making closer to the people and returning powers to Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.\nAnd with control of our borders, we can do something that no British government has been able to do in decades - restore full and complete control of who comes into this country to the\ndemocratically elected representatives of the British people.\nAnd this is what we will do with the immigration powers we take back.\nThe free movement of people will end, once and for all. In its place we will introduce a new system. It will be based on what skills you have to offer, not which country you come from.\nThroughout our history, migrants have made a huge contribution to our country - and they will continue to in the future.\nThose with the skills we need, who want to come here and work hard, will find a welcome. But we will be able to reduce the numbers, as we promised.\nAnd by ending free movement we will give British business an incentive to train our own young people and to invest in technology that will improve their productivity.\nSo this is our proposal. Taking back control of our borders, laws and money.\nGood for jobs, good for the Union. It delivers on the referendum. It keeps faith with the British people. It is in the national interest.\nEven if we do not all agree on every part of this proposal, we need to come together. Because it's time we faced up to what is at risk.\nWe have a Labour Party that, if they were in Government, would accept any deal the EU chose to offer, regardless of how bad it is for the UK.\nBut who also say they'll oppose any deal I choose to bring back, regardless of how good it is for the UK.\nThey are not acting in the national interest, but their own political interest.\nAnd there are plenty of prominent people in British politics - in Parliament and out of it - who want to stop Brexit in its tracks.\nTheir latest plan is to hold a second referendum.\nThey call it a 'People's Vote'. But we had the people's vote. The people voted to leave.\nA second referendum would be a \"politicians' vote\": politicians telling people they got it wrong the first time and should try again.\nThink for a moment what it would do to faith in our democracy if - having asked the people of this country to take this decision - politicians tried to overturn it.\nThose of us who do respect the result - whichever side of the question we stood on two years ago - need to come together now.\nIf we don't - if we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit - we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.\nAnd there's another reason why we need to come together.\nWe are entering the toughest phase of the negotiations.\nYou saw in Salzburg that I am standing up for Britain. What we are proposing is very challenging for the EU. But if we stick together and hold our nerve I know we can get a deal that delivers for Britain.\nAnd ultimately that's what it's all about.\nThe people we serve are not interested in debates about the theory of Brexit - their livelihoods depend on making a success of it in practice.\nA Brexit that might make Britain stronger fifty years from now is no good to you if it makes your life harder today.\nIf you work in a factory in Pendle, you need a Brexit that keeps trade friction-free and supply-chains flowing.\nIf you are a fisherman in Peterhead, you need a Brexit that delivers full control of our waters.\nIf you run an exporting business in Penarth, you need a Brexit that will open up new global markets.\nIf you live in Pettigo on the Irish border, you need a Brexit that keeps it frictionless and communities connected.\nThese things matter to you - so they matter to me. You are the people we are all here to serve.\nAnd together we will build a brighter future for the whole United Kingdom.\nI passionately believe that our best days lie ahead of us and that our future is full of promise.\nWe have fundamental strengths as a country.\nEnglish is the global language.\nWe can trade with Shanghai over morning coffee and San Francisco at tea time.\nOur courts are incorruptible.\nOur universities, world-leading.\nOur soft power, unrivalled.\nA driving force in the Commonwealth.\nA permanent member of the UN Security Council.\nAnd soon we will retake our own seat at the World Trade Organisation.\nBritain will be a champion for free trade right across the globe - and I want to thank our fantastic trade envoys for leading that work.\nBut our greatest strength of all is the talent and diversity of our people.\nWe have produced more Nobel Prize winners than any country apart from America.\nWe are home to amazing innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs.\nOur wonderful public servants are the best in the world.\nThe compassion of our NHS staff, the dedication of our teachers, the bravery of our police, and the matchless courage of our armed forces.\nDon't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes: we have everything we need to succeed.\nAnd in 2022 we will put the best of British creativity and innovation, culture and heritage on show in a year-long festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nWherever I travel, I find a renewed interest in Britain.\nLet me give you one example.\nLast month I became the first British Prime Minister to visit Kenya in 30 years.\nThis is a Commonwealth partner, a nation of over 50 million people, on a continent that will be an engine-room of economic growth in the years ahead.\nTheir message to me was clear: our businesses want to trade with you.\nOur young people want to study with you.\nOur scientists and artists want to collaborate with you.\nYet I was the first Prime Minister to visit since Margaret Thatcher.\nThere is a whole world out there. Let's lift our horizons to meet it.\nThe UK has always been an outward-looking trading nation.\nAnd as Conservatives, we believe in the power of a well-regulated free market - the greatest agent of collective human progress ever devised.\nIn the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half.\nGlobal life expectancy has increased by nearly 20 years.\nChild mortality has halved.\nBut the free market hasn't just saved lives, it has improved them: the internet, smartphones, cheap air travel, electric cars, even flat-pack furniture.\nWe should defend free markets, because it is ordinary working people who benefit.\nClosed markets and command economies were not overthrown by powerful elites, but by ordinary people.\nBy the shipyard workers of Gdansk, who led the resistance in Poland.\nBy people of all backgrounds who took part in the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia.\nBy the people of East Berlin, who tore down that wall.\nThese were the many, not the few.\nAnd when the many have the freedom to choose, they choose freedom.\nI saw it last month in South Africa.\nI was speaking to some inspiring young people, full of fire and hope for their futures. Some told me they wanted to be doctors, others lawyers.\nI think some might even have been inspired to become professional dancers. Perhaps not.\nBut one young woman said something else. She told me her ambition was to start a business, so she could create jobs in her local community.\nThe people in this hall who have started their own businesses will know how thrilling it is to take a risk and start something new.\nBut offering someone a job - creating opportunity for other people - is one of the most socially-responsible things you can do.\nIt is an act of public service as noble as any other. To everyone who has done it - we are all in your debt. So, we in this party, we in this hall, we say thank you.\nAnd to all businesses - large and small - you may have heard that there is a four-letter word to describe what we Conservatives want to do to you.\nIt has a single syllable. It is of Anglo-Saxon derivation. It ends in the letter 'K'.\nBack business.\nBack them to create jobs and build prosperity.\nBack them to drive innovation and improve lives.\nBack them with the lowest Corporation Tax in the G20.\nBritain, under my Conservative Government, is open for business.\nWe support free markets because we know their strengths.\nBut we also know their limits.\nThe defining event for a new generation of voters was not the fall of the Berlin Wall, but the collapse of the banks.\nIt was the biggest market failure in our lifetimes.\nA recession in which almost three quarters of a million jobs were lost.\nSound businesses forced to close because they could not access credit.\nPeople queuing to withdraw their money from Northern Rock.\nThanks to Labour, the country was not prepared.\nThe government ended up borrowing lb1 for every lb4 it spent.\nIt fell to our party to clear up the mess.\nEight years on, how have we done?\nOur economy is growing.\nThe deficit down by four-fifths.\nUnemployment at its lowest since the 1970s.\nYouth unemployment at a record low.\nHouseholds where nobody works down by almost a million.\nWe should not forget what's behind those numbers.\nThe parent who swaps a benefit cheque for a regular wage.\nThe youngster leaving school and never having to sign on.\nThe children growing up with an example of hard work.\nHope and dignity for millions of people in our country.\nWe should be proud of our record.\nBut our pride in those achievements should not blind us to the challenges that remain.\nThe after-effects of the crash are still being felt - in four important ways.\nSome markets are still not working in the interests of ordinary people.\nEmployment is up, but too many people haven't had a decent pay rise.\nThe deficit is down, but achieving that has been painful.\nAnd our economy is growing, but some communities have been left behind.\nThis is why some people still feel that our economy isn't working for them.\nOur mission as Conservatives must be to show them that we can build an economy that does.\nIn Liverpool last week, all Labour offered were bogus solutions that would make things worse.\nIdeas that might seem attractive at first glance, but which would hurt the very people they claim to help.\nTheir flagship announcement was a case in point.\nIt would mean the government effectively confiscating a tenth of every company with more than 250 employees.\nWorkers wouldn't become shareholders - and much of the income generated would end up with the government.\nThey dress it up as employee ownership, but it's a giant stealth tax on enterprise.\nIt would slash the share prices of British businesses, hitting anyone with a private pension.\nAnd it would make the UK an unattractive place to invest, driving away business, destroying jobs.\nThe same is true of their nationalisation policy.\nThey want our railways and utilities to be owned entirely by the Government.\nBut when you nationalise something, people pay for it twice - once when they use the service, and again every month through their taxes.\nAnd investment in them goes down, because when governments are setting budgets, they will always choose schools and hospitals over reservoirs and railways, so people get a worse service.\nEven some in the Labour Party admit their programme of nationalisation, and their endless expensive promises, would cost lb1 trillion.\nYou heard me right - one thousand billion pounds.\nThat is not government money but your money.\nBecause Labour would have to pay for it by raising taxes higher and higher.\nOf course, everyone should pay their fair share.\nBut when you raise taxes too high, businesses cannot afford to invest.\nThey cannot afford to take on new employees.\nEventually, they cannot afford to operate here at all.\nThey move abroad, create jobs in other countries, pay taxes somewhere else, and leave us poorer.\nThey would also have to increase borrowing again.\nWe already spend more each year on debt interest than we do on our schools.\nAfter all the sacrifices we have made, they would take us back to square one.\nThese ideas won't help people who are struggling, they will hurt them.\nHurt workers, whose jobs would go as businesses left Britain.\nHurt pensioners, whose savings would be devalued.\nAnd hurt young people, whose future Labour would mortgage.\nHowever bad the Labour approach is, we must do more than criticise it.\nWe need to show what this Conservative government is doing to address people's concerns.\nFirst, we need to make markets work in the interests of ordinary people again.\nThat's why we toughened up our corporate governance rules.\nWe are giving workers a stronger voice in the boardroom.\nWe have changed the rules on bonuses, so bosses are rewarded for long-term performance, not short-term profit.\nIt's why, with the gig economy changing how people work, we are changing our employment rules, so new technology cannot undermine workers' rights.\nIt's why we introduced the energy price cap.\nAnnounced at last year's conference, and in place for this winter.\nIt will stop energy firms charging their most loyal customers unfair prices.\nAny other companies charging their customers a 'loyalty penalty' should know: we will take action.\nBecause we put the interest of consumers first, we have also announced a fundamental review into our railways.\nSince privatisation, investment in the network has gone up, safety has improved, and more people are travelling by rail than ever before.\nBut on some routes the service has not been good enough. We will fix that.\nAnd while we do so, we will bring in a new system of auto-compensation, so that when your train is late you won't have to waste more time getting your money back.\nLast year I made it my personal mission to fix another broken market: housing.\nWe cannot make the case for capitalism if ordinary working people have no chance of owning capital.\nTo put the dream of home ownership back within their reach, we scrapped stamp duty for most first-time buyers - and over 120,000 households have already benefited.\nWe've helped half a million people onto the housing ladder through other schemes like Help to Buy.\nAnd this week we have announced that we will charge a higher rate of stamp duty on those buying homes who do not live and pay taxes in the UK, to help level the playing field for British buyers.\nThe money raised will go towards tackling the scourge of rough sleeping.\nBut the truth is that while these measures will help in the short term, we will only fix this broken market by building more homes.\nAnd that is what we are doing.\nMore new homes were added to our stock last year than in all but one of the last 30 years.\nBut we need to do better still.\nThe last time Britain was building enough homes - half a century ago - local councils made a big contribution.\nWe've opened-up the lb9 billion Affordable Housing Programme to councils, to get them building again.\nAnd at last year's conference I announced an additional lb2 billion for affordable housing.\nBut something is still holding many of them back.\nThere is a government cap on how much they can borrow against their Housing Revenue Account assets to fund new developments.\nSolving the housing crisis is the biggest domestic policy challenge of our generation.\nIt doesn't make sense to stop councils from playing their part in solving it.\nSo today I can announce that we are scrapping that cap.\nWe will help you get on the housing ladder.\nAnd we will build the homes this country needs.\nOur next challenge is to help working people with the cost of living.\nWe know how hard people work to make ends meet and provide for their families.\nIt isn't easy. It never has been.\nAnd the difference it makes to have a little bit of money left to put away at the end of each month isn't measured in pounds and pence.\nIt's the look on a daughter's face when her mum says she can have the bike she wants for her birthday.\nIt's the joy and precious memories that a week's holiday with the family brings.\nIt's the peace of mind that comes with having some savings.\nMany people, in towns and cities across our country, cannot take these things for granted.\nThey are the people this party exists for.\nThey are the people for whom this party must deliver.\nIt's for them that we cut income tax.\nIntroduced a National Living Wage.\nExtended free childcare.\nAnd froze fuel duty every year.\nBecause for millions of people, their car is not a luxury. It's a necessity.\nSome have wondered if there would be a thaw in our policy this year.\nToday I can confirm, given the high oil price, the Chancellor will freeze fuel duty once again in his budget later this month.\nMoney in the pockets of hard-working people.\nA Conservative Government that is on their side.\nThird, after a decade of austerity, people need to know that their hard work has paid off.\nBecause of that hard work, and the decisions taken by the Chancellor, our national debt is starting to fall for the first time in a generation.\nThis is a historic achievement.\nBut getting to this turning point wasn't easy.\nPublic sector workers had their wages frozen.\nLocal services had to do more with less.\nAnd families felt the squeeze.\nFixing our finances was necessary.\nThere must be no return to the uncontrolled borrowing of the past.\nNo undoing all the progress of the last eight years.\nNo taking Britain back to square one.\nBut the British people need to know that the end is in sight.\nAnd our message to them must be this: we get it.\nWe are not just a party to clean up a mess, we are the party to steer a course to a better future.\nSound finances are essential, but they are not the limit of our ambition.\nBecause you made sacrifices, there are better days ahead.\nSo, when we've secured a good Brexit deal for Britain, at the Spending Review next year we will set out our approach for the future.\nDebt as a share of the economy will continue to go down, support for public services will go up.\nBecause, a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off.\nThe final challenge is about the future we want for our economy.\nWe stand on the threshold of technological changes that will transform how we live and work, travel and communicate.\nThis has the potential to improve the lives of everyone in society, but only if we take the right decisions now.\nAt times of change in the past, the benefits have not been evenly spread.\nSome communities have been left behind. This time it must be different.\nBecause we are all worse off when any part of us is held back.\nThat means doing things differently.\nOur Modern Industrial Strategy is helping the whole country get ready for the economic change that is coming.\nWe are investing in infrastructure.\nWe are doing more than anyone since the Victorians to upgrade our railways.\nOur road-building programme is the largest since the 1970s.\nWe have taken the big decision to build a third runway at Heathrow.\nW\n\r\n\nWe are investing in our workforce - helping people train and retrain.\n\r\n\nIn our schools, we are keeping standards high.\n\r\n\nAnd where Labour want to roll-back reform, scrap academies and kill off free schools, we will build more of them, because every child deserves a great start in life.\n\r\n\nEvery child, in every town and city, across the whole country.\n\r\n\nSo that is our Conservative answer.\n\r\n\nFixing markets not destroying them.\n\r\n\nHelping with the cost of living.\n\r\n\nEnding austerity.\n\r\n\nAn economy of the future with nowhere left behind.\n\r\n\nThis is how we will build a country that works for everyone.\n\r\n\nI made that my mission when I stood for the leadership.\n\r\n\nIt was what I dedicated my government to on the steps of Downing Street.\n\r\n\nAnd it is the future this Party will deliver.\n\r\n\nEvery person in this hall has the power to shape that future.\n\r\n\nThis is a moment of opportunity for our party.\n\r\n\nTo champion decency in our politics.\n\r\n\nTo be the moderate, patriotic government this country needs.\n\r\n\nTo be a party not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules.\n\r\n\r\n\nAnd it's a moment of opportunity for our country.\n\r\n\r\n\nTo honour the result of the referendum.\n\r\n\nTo come together to make a success of the decision we took.\n\r\n\nTo build the homes we need.\n\r\n\nTo get the next generation on the housing ladder.\n\r\n\nTo help people who are struggling to make ends meet.\n\r\n\nTo invest in our vital public services.\n\r\n\nTo renew our precious National Health Service.\n\r\n\nTo lead the world in the technologies of the future.\n\r\n\nTo ensure every family and every community shares the success.\n\r\n\nTo tackle the burning injustices that hold people back.\n\r\n\nWe stand at a pivotal moment in our history.\n\r\n\nIt falls to our party to lead our country through it.\n\r\n\nWhen we come together there is no limit to what we can achieve.\n\r\n\nOurs is a great country. Our future is in our hands.\n\r\n\nTogether, let's seize it.\n\r\n\nTogether, let's build a better Britain.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\nThank you very much for that warm welcome.\n\r\n\nYou'll have to excuse me if I cough during this speech; I've been up all night supergluing the backdrop.\n\r\n\nThere are some things about last year's conference I have tried to forget. But I will always remember the warmth I felt from everyone in the hall. You supported me all the way - thank you.\n\r\n\nThis year marks a century since the end of the First World War.\n\r\n\nJust a few hundred yards from this conference centre stands a Hall of Memory, built to honour the sacrifice of men and women from this city in that terrible conflict.\n\r\n\nInscribed within it are some familiar words:\n\r\n\n\"At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember them.\"\n\r\n\nWe do remember them.\n\r\n\nWe remember the young men who left their homes to fight and die in the mud and horror of the trenches.\n\r\n\nWe remember the sailors who shovelled coal into hellfire furnaces in the bowels of battleships.\n\r\n\nWe remember the selflessness of a remarkable generation, whose legacy is the freedom we enjoy today.\n\r\n\r\n\nI think of Hubert Grant - my father's cousin in whose honour he was named. Hubert fought and died at Passchendaele at the age of just 19.\n\r\n\r\n\nLast year, at the service to mark the centenary of that battle, I took a moment to find his name on the Menin Gate, alongside thousands of his comrades.\n\r\n\nWe will remember them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBut the builders of that Hall of Memory also wanted us to do something else. Alongside a commitment to remember, they inscribed a command that still calls to us today:\n\r\n\n\"See to it that they shall not have suffered and died in vain.\"\n\r\n\nThose words express a determination that transformed our country. A determination that the men who returned from the quagmires of Passchendaele to their families, here in Birmingham and across the land, should have homes fit for heroes.\n\r\n\nThat the women who made munitions, kept the buses and trains running, served as firefighters and police officers, should have a voice in our democracy.\n\r\n\nThat a country which stood together in solidarity, with people of every class sharing the danger, should become a fairer place.\n\r\n\nA generation later, another victory built on shared sacrifice renewed that determination.\n\r\n\nTwice in a century, Britain came together to beat the odds and build a better future.\n\r\n\nA stronger democracy in the Mother of Parliaments - where every person, no matter their gender, no matter their class, has an equal voice.\n\r\n\r\n\nA fairer economy in the home of the free market - where enterprise creates wealth to fund great public services.\n\r\n\nA more secure future in the post-war world - where former enemies become friends and the trans-Atlantic alliance makes our world a safer place.\n\r\n\nWe must recapture that spirit of common purpose.\n\r\n\nBecause the lesson of that remarkable generation is clear: if we come together, there is no limit to what we can achieve. Our future is in our hands. And that is why we are all in this hall today. It is the reason we chose to get involved in politics in the first place.\n\r\n\nWe believe that by standing up to be counted, by working together, we can change our communities and our country for the better.\n\r\n\nIt's not always glamorous.\n\r\n\nI've seen the trailers for 'Bodyguard' and let me tell you - it wasn't like that in my day.\n\r\n\nReal politics involves a lot of hard graft. Knocking on doors in all weathers. Delivering bundles of leaflets. We do it because we believe in its potential to transform lives.\n\r\n\nWe understood when we got involved that sometimes it's adversarial. But in the last few years something's changed for the worse. I feel it. I am sure you do too.\n\r\n\r\n\nRigorous debate between political opponents is becoming more like a confrontation between enemies. People who put themselves forward to serve are becoming targets. Not just them, their families as well.\n\r\n\nWe all saw the sickening pictures of a far-left extremist shouting abuse at Jacob Rees-Mogg's children.\n\r\n\nAnd it's not only Conservatives who are facing abuse.\n\r\n\nThe first black woman ever to be elected to the House of Commons receives more racist and misogynist messages today than when she first stood over 30 years ago.\n\r\n\nYou do not have to agree with a word Diane Abbott says to believe passionately in her right to say it, free from threats and abuse.\n\r\n\nSome people have lost sight of the fact that political differences are not everything.\n\r\n\nI have served in local and national government, in office and in opposition. I know that no party has a monopoly on good ideas. That getting things done requires working together - within parties and beyond them.\n\r\n\nWhen our politics becomes polarised, and compromise becomes a dirty word, that becomes harder.\n\r\n\nAnd good people are put off public service.\n\r\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way.\n\r\n\nOur party has more elected representatives than any other.\n\r\n\r\n\nWe have in our hands the power to set a standard of decency that will be an example for others to follow.\n\r\n\nJohn McCain, who spoke at this conference 12 years ago, put it like this: \"We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement.\"\n\r\n\nThat was Jo Cox's message too.\n\r\n\nIt is a truth that the British people instinctively understand. Because they are not ideologues.\n\r\n\nThey know we all have a common stake in this country and that the only path to a better future is one that we walk down together.\n\r\n\nSo, let's rise above the abuse.\n\r\n\nLet's make a positive case for our values that will cut through the bitterness and bile that is poisoning our politics.\n\r\n\nLet's say it loud and clear: Conservatives will always stand up for a politics that unites us rather than divides us.\n\r\n\nThat used to be Labour's position too. But when I look at its leadership today, I worry it's no longer the case.\n\r\n\nWe all remember what the Labour Party used to be. We passionately disagreed with many of their policies.\n\r\n\r\n\nEvery Labour Government left unemployment higher than they found it.\n\r\n\nEvery Labour Government ran out of other people's money to spend.\n\r\n\nEvery Labour Government left the economy in a mess.\n\r\n\nBut at least they had some basic qualities that everyone could respect. They were proud of our institutions. They were proud of our armed forces. They were proud of Britain.\n\r\n\nToday, when I look across at the opposition benches, I can still see that Labour Party.\n\r\n\nThe heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Dennis Healy and John Smith. But not on the front bench.\n\r\n\nInstead their faces stare blankly out from the rows behind, while another party occupies prime position: the Jeremy Corbyn Party.\n\r\n\nThe Jeremy Corbyn Party rejects the common values that once bridged our political divide.\n\r\n\nCompare Jeremy Corbyn's behaviour to that of his predecessors.\n\r\n\nWould Neil Kinnock, who stood-up to the hard-left, have stood by while his own MPs faced deselection, and needed police protection at their Party conference?\n\r\n\nWould Jim Callaghan, who served in the Royal Navy, have asked the Russian government to confirm the findings of our own intelligence agencies?\n\r\n\nWould Clement Attlee, Churchill's trusted deputy during the Second World War, have told British Jews they didn't know the meaning of anti-semitism?\n\r\n\r\n\nWhat has befallen Labour is a national tragedy.\n\r\n\nWhat has it come to when Jewish families today seriously discuss where they should go if Jeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister? When a leading Labour MP says his party is 'institutionally racist'? When the Leader of the Labour Party is happy to appear on Iranian state TV, but attacks our free media here in Britain?\n\r\n\nThat is what Jeremy Corbyn has done to the Labour Party. It is our duty, in this Conservative Party, to make sure he can never do it to our country.\n\r\n\nTo do that we need to be a Party for the whole country.\n\r\n\nBecause today millions of people, who have never supported our Party in the past, are appalled by what Jeremy Corbyn has done to Labour.\n\r\n\nThey want to support a party that is decent, moderate, and patriotic. One that puts the national interest first. Delivers on the issues they care about. And is comfortable with modern Britain in all its diversity.\n\r\n\nWe must show everyone in this country that we are that Party.\n\r\n\nA Party that conserves the best of our inheritance, but is not afraid of change. A party of patriotism, but not nationalism.\n\r\n\r\n\nA party that believes in business, but is not afraid to hold businesses to account.\n\r\n\nA party that believes in the good that government can do, but knows government will never have all the answers.\n\r\n\nA party that believes your success in life should not be defined by who you love, your faith, the colour of your skin, who your parents were, or where you were raised - but by your talent and your hard work.\n\r\n\nAbove all a party of Unionism, not just of four proud nations, but of all our people.\n\r\n\nA party not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best.\n\r\n\nAnd we must be a party that is not in thrall to ideology, but motivated instead by enduring principles.\n\r\n\nFor me they can be summed-up in three words: Security. Freedom. Opportunity.\n\r\n\nSecurity for the nation with strong defences against threats from abroad, and protection against threats at home. Security for communities, upheld by the brave men and women of our police forces. Security for individuals and families, provided by a good job, a home of your own, and dignity in old age. And security is the bedrock of freedom.\n\r\n\r\n\nFreedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of action. The freedom to make decisions for yourself, rather than have them made for you by government. The freedom that our grandparents and great grandparents fought for against tyranny. The freedom that swept across Eastern Europe when the Soviet Union collapsed, and nations were reborn in sovereignty and independence. The freedom that is still denied to many in our world today.\n\r\n\nBut with freedom should always come responsibility. To obey the law, even when you disagree with it. To conserve our environment, for the next generation.\n\r\n\nAnd most especially for those in public life - the responsibility to weigh the impact our words and actions have on other people.\n\r\n\nAnd if we are secure and we are free, then opportunity is opened-up.\n\r\n\nThe opportunity to take your future in your hands. To dream, and strive, and achieve a better life. To know that if your dad arrived on a plane from Pakistan, you can become Home Secretary. That if you spent time in care, you can be in the Cabinet. That if your grandparents came to our shores as part of the Windrush generation, you could be the next Mayor of London. That if you are pregnant with your first child and engaged to your girlfriend, you could be the next First Minister of Scotland.\n\r\n\r\n\nWe, the Conservative Party, are the party of opportunity.\n\r\n\nNo institution embodies our principles as Conservatives more profoundly or more personally than our National Health Service. It gives every man, woman and child the absolute security of knowing that whenever you are sick, care will be there.\n\r\n\nWhat greater freedom than to live your life never having to worry about whether you can afford the treatment you need? What greater opportunity for a country to make the most of all its talents?\n\r\n\nThe NHS is a service that is there for everyone; free at the point of use; with care based always on clinical need, never the ability to pay. These principles are in our country's DNA. And Conservatives will always uphold them.\n\r\n\nIndeed, Conservatives have looked after our NHS for most of its life. And this year we gave the NHS a seventieth birthday present to be proud of: the biggest cash boost in its history. An extra lb394 million every single week.\n\r\n\nAnd in return, the NHS will produce a new long-term plan to make sure every penny makes a difference on the front line. So, next time you hear someone say that the Tories don't care about the NHS, tell them about that extra funding.\n\r\n\r\n\nTell them about the Conservative MPs who work in the NHS in their spare time.\n\r\n\nTell them about the Tory Prime Minister who can only do her job thanks to the wonderful staff of her local NHS trust, who help her manage diabetes.\n\r\n\nTell them about our Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire. Last year James officially opened the new Guy's Cancer Centre at Queen Mary's Hospital in his constituency. A few months later he was a patient.\n\r\n\nThe outstanding NHS care he received helped him recover, and now he is back serving in the Cabinet.\n\r\n\nCancer can strike any of us at any time. A few years ago, my goddaughter was diagnosed with cancer. She underwent treatment and it seemed to be working. But then the cancer came back. Last summer, she sent me a text to tell me that she was hoping to see another Christmas. But she didn't make it.\n\r\n\nHalf of us will be diagnosed with cancer. All of us know someone who has been. Survival rates are increasing, but we are lagging behind other countries.\n\r\n\nSo today I can announce a new Cancer Strategy, funded through our 70th birthday investment, will form a central part of our long-term plan for the NHS.\n\r\n\r\n\nThe key to boosting your chance of surviving cancer is early diagnosis.\n\r\n\r\n\nFive-year survival rates for bowel cancer are over 90% if caught early, but less than 10% if diagnosed late.\n\r\n\nThrough our Cancer Strategy, we will increase the early detection rate from one-in-two today, to-three-in four by 2028.\n\r\n\nWe will do it by lowering the age at which we screen for bowel cancer from 60 to 50. By investing in the very latest scanners. And by building more Rapid Diagnostic Centres - one stop-shops that help people get treatment quicker.\n\r\n\nThis will be a step-change in how we diagnose cancer.\n\r\n\nIt will mean that by 2028, 55,000 more people will be alive five years after their diagnosis compared to today.\n\r\n\nEvery life saved means precious extra years with friends and family. Every life saved means a parent, a partner, a child, a god mother spared the pain of losing a loved one before their time.\n\r\n\nOur NHS saves countless lives every day. That is never more true than when our national security is threatened. Those are the times when I feel most keenly the responsibilities of my office.\n\r\n\nWhen I have to ask our brave servicemen and women to put themselves in harm's way. To protect our citizens. To support our allies, as we would expect them to support us. To uphold the international rules on which our security depends.\n\r\n\r\n\nLike when the Syrian regime attacked Douma with chemical weapons, killing innocent men, women and children. We joined with our friends to send a message that the use of chemical weapons will never be tolerated. I took the decision to send RAF jets to strike against Assad's chemical weapons facilities. As Prime Minister, I had to make the call, and then be held to account for it.\n\r\n\nThe same was true when Russia launched a chemical attack on the streets of the United Kingdom. I took the decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats who were undeclared intelligence officers. Our allies joined with us in degrading Russia's intelligence network.\n\r\n\nIn Parliament I received almost universal support - from the SNP to the Liberal Democrats and the Labour backbenches.\n\r\n\nThere was just one dissenting voice - Jeremy Corbyn. Dismissing the findings of our security services. Suggesting that the country responsible for the attack should double-check the findings of our chemical weapons scientists. Refusing to lay the blame squarely where it belonged. Just imagine if he were Prime Minister.\n\r\n\nHe says Britain should disarm herself in the hope others follow suit.\n\r\n\nI say no - we must keep our defences strong to keep our country safe.\n\r\n\r\n\nHe says a strong NATO simply provokes Russia.\n\r\n\nI say no - it is the guarantor of our freedom and security.\n\r\n\nHe poses as a humanitarian. But he says that military action to save lives is only justified with the approval of the Security Council - effectively giving Russia a veto.\n\r\n\nI say no - we cannot outsource our conscience to the Kremlin.\n\r\n\nLeadership is doing what you believe to be right and having the courage and determination to see it through. That is the approach I have taken on Brexit.\n\r\n\nWe have had disagreements in this Party about Britain's membership of the EU for a long time. So, it is no surprise that we have had a range of different views expressed this week.\n\r\n\nBut my job as Prime Minister is to do what I believe to be in the national interest. And that means two things.\n\r\n\nFirst, honouring the result of the referendum.\n\r\n\nMPs asked the British people to take this decision. We put our faith in their judgement. They have put their faith in us to deliver. I will not let them down.\n\r\n\nAnd secondly, to seek a good trading and security relationship with our neighbours after we have left. They are our close friends and allies, and we should ensure it stays that way. That's what I said at Lancaster House. It's what we promised in our manifesto. And it's what I've worked day and night for the last two years to achieve.\n\r\n\r\n\nNo-one wants a good deal more than me. But that has never meant getting a deal at any cost. Britain isn't afraid to leave with no deal if we have to.\n\r\n\nBut we need to be honest about it. Leaving without a deal - introducing tariffs and costly checks at the border - would be a bad outcome for the UK and the EU.\n\r\n\nIt would be tough at first, but the resilience and ingenuity of the British people would see us through. Some people ask me to rule out no deal. But if I did that I would weaken our negotiating position and have to agree to whatever the EU offers.\n\r\n\nAnd at the moment that would mean accepting one of two things.\n\r\n\nEither a deal that keeps us in the EU in all but name, keeps free movement, keeps vast annual payments and stops us signing trade deals with other countries.\n\r\n\nOr a deal that carves off Northern Ireland, a part of this country, effectively leaving it in the EU's Custom's Union.\n\r\n\nSo, let us send a clear message from this hall today: we will never accept either of those choices. We will not betray the result of the referendum. And we will never break up our country.\n\r\n\r\n\nI have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same.\n\r\n\nIn a negotiation, if you can't accept what the other side proposes, you present an alternative. That is what we have done.\n\r\n\nOur proposal is for a free trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods.\n\r\n\nIt would protect hundreds of thousands of jobs in the just-in-time supply chains our manufacturing firms rely on.\n\r\n\nBusinesses wouldn't face costly checks when they export to the EU, so they can invest with confidence.\n\r\n\nAnd it would protect our precious Union - the seamless border in Northern Ireland, a bedrock of peace and stability, would see no change whatsoever.\n\r\n\nNo simple free trade agreement could achieve that, not even one that makes use of the very latest technology.\n\r\n\nOur proposal would be good for our rural communities, getting us out of the Common Agricultural Policy.\n\r\n\nIt would be good for our coastal communities.\n\r\n\nWe would be out of the Common Fisheries Policy, an independent coastal state once again.\n\r\n\nAnd with the UK's biggest fishing fleets based in Scotland, let me say this to Nicola Sturgeon.\n\r\n\nYou claim to stand up for Scotland, but you want to lock Scottish fishermen into the CFP forever. That's not 'Stronger for Scotland', it's a betrayal of Scotland.\n\r\n\r\n\nOur proposal would mean we could renew our role in the world, strike new trade deals with other countries.\n\r\n\nWith control of our money, we can spend more on our NHS.\n\r\n\nWith control of our laws, we can bring decision-making closer to the people and returning powers to Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.\n\r\n\nAnd with control of our borders, we can do something that no British government has been able to do in decades - restore full and complete control of who comes into this country to the\n\r\n\ndemocratically elected representatives of the British people.\n\r\n\nAnd this is what we will do with the immigration powers we take back.\n\r\n\nThe free movement of people will end, once and for all. In its place we will introduce a new system. It will be based on what skills you have to offer, not which country you come from.\n\r\n\nThroughout our history, migrants have made a huge contribution to our country - and they will continue to in the future.\n\r\n\nThose with the skills we need, who want to come here and work hard, will find a welcome. But we will be able to reduce the numbers, as we promised.\n\r\n\nAnd by ending free movement we will give British business an incentive to train our own young people and to invest in technology that will improve their productivity.\n\r\n\r\n\nSo this is our proposal. Taking back control of our borders, laws and money.\n\r\n\nGood for jobs, good for the Union. It delivers on the referendum. It keeps faith with the British people. It is in the national interest.\n\r\n\nEven if we do not all agree on every part of this proposal, we need to come together. Because it's time we faced up to what is at risk.\n\r\n\nWe have a Labour Party that, if they were in Government, would accept any deal the EU chose to offer, regardless of how bad it is for the UK.\n\r\n\nBut who also say they'll oppose any deal I choose to bring back, regardless of how good it is for the UK.\n\r\n\nThey are not acting in the national interest, but their own political interest.\n\r\n\nAnd there are plenty of prominent people in British politics - in Parliament and out of it - who want to stop Brexit in its tracks.\n\r\n\nTheir latest plan is to hold a second referendum.\n\r\n\nThey call it a 'People's Vote'. But we had the people's vote. The people voted to leave.\n\r\n\nA second referendum would be a \"politicians' vote\": politicians telling people they got it wrong the first time and should try again.\n\r\n\r\n\nThink for a moment what it would do to faith in our democracy if - having asked the people of this country to take this decision - politicians tried to overturn it.\n\r\n\nThose of us who do respect the result - whichever side of the question we stood on two years ago - need to come together now.\n\r\n\nIf we don't - if we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit - we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.\n\r\n\nAnd there's another reason why we need to come together.\n\r\n\nWe are entering the toughest phase of the negotiations.\n\r\n\nYou saw in Salzburg that I am standing up for Britain. What we are proposing is very challenging for the EU. But if we stick together and hold our nerve I know we can get a deal that delivers for Britain.\n\r\n\nAnd ultimately that's what it's all about.\n\r\n\nThe people we serve are not interested in debates about the theory of Brexit - their livelihoods depend on making a success of it in practice.\n\r\n\nA Brexit that might make Britain stronger fifty years from now is no good to you if it makes your life harder today.\n\r\n\r\n\nIf you work in a factory in Pendle, you need a Brexit that keeps trade friction-free and supply-chains flowing.\n\r\n\nIf you are a fisherman in Peterhead, you need a Brexit that delivers full control of our waters.\n\r\n\nIf you run an exporting business in Penarth, you need a Brexit that will open up new global markets.\n\r\n\nIf you live in Pettigo on the Irish border, you need a Brexit that keeps it frictionless and communities connected.\n\r\n\nThese things matter to you - so they matter to me. You are the people we are all here to serve.\n\r\n\nAnd together we will build a brighter future for the whole United Kingdom.\n\r\n\nI passionately believe that our best days lie ahead of us and that our future is full of promise.\n\r\n\nWe have fundamental strengths as a country.\n\r\n\nEnglish is the global language.\n\r\n\nWe can trade with Shanghai over morning coffee and San Francisco at tea time.\n\r\n\nOur courts are incorruptible.\n\r\n\nOur universities, world-leading.\n\r\n\nOur soft power, unrivalled.\n\r\n\nA driving force in the Commonwealth.\n\r\n\nA permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\r\n\nAnd soon we will retake our own seat at the World Trade Organisation.\n\r\n\nBritain will be a champion for free trade right across the globe - and I want to thank our fantastic trade envoys for leading that work.\n\r\n\r\n\nBut our greatest strength of all is the talent and diversity of our people.\n\r\n\nWe have produced more Nobel Prize winners than any country apart from America.\n\r\n\nWe are home to amazing innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs.\n\r\n\nOur wonderful public servants are the best in the world.\n\r\n\nThe compassion of our NHS staff, the dedication of our teachers, the bravery of our police, and the matchless courage of our armed forces.\n\r\n\nDon't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes: we have everything we need to succeed.\n\r\n\nAnd in 2022 we will put the best of British creativity and innovation, culture and heritage on show in a year-long festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\r\n\r\n\nWherever I travel, I find a renewed interest in Britain.\n\r\n\nLet me give you one example.\n\r\n\nLast month I became the first British Prime Minister to visit Kenya in 30 years.\n\r\n\nThis is a Commonwealth partner, a nation of over 50 million people, on a continent that will be an engine-room of economic growth in the years ahead.\n\r\n\nTheir message to me was clear: our businesses want to trade with you.\n\r\n\nOur young people want to study with you.\n\r\n\nOur scientists and artists want to collaborate with you.\n\r\n\r\n\nYet I was the first Prime Minister to visit since Margaret Thatcher.\n\r\n\nThere is a whole world out there. Let's lift our horizons to meet it.\n\r\n\nThe UK has always been an outward-looking trading nation.\n\r\n\nAnd as Conservatives, we believe in the power of a well-regulated free market - the greatest agent of collective human progress ever devised.\n\r\n\nIn the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half.\n\r\n\nGlobal life expectancy has increased by nearly 20 years.\n\r\n\nChild mortality has halved.\n\r\n\nBut the free market hasn't just saved lives, it has improved them: the internet, smartphones, cheap air travel, electric cars, even flat-pack furniture.\n\r\n\nWe should defend free markets, because it is ordinary working people who benefit.\n\r\n\nClosed markets and command economies were not overthrown by powerful elites, but by ordinary people.\n\r\n\nBy the shipyard workers of Gdansk, who led the resistance in Poland.\n\r\n\nBy people of all backgrounds who took part in the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia.\n\r\n\nBy the people of East Berlin, who tore down that wall.\n\r\n\nThese were the many, not the few.\n\r\n\nAnd when the many have the freedom to choose, they choose freedom.\n\r\n\nI saw it last month in South Africa.\n\r\n\nI was speaking to some inspiring young people, full of fire and hope for their futures. Some told me they wanted to be doctors, others lawyers.\n\r\n\r\n\nI think some might even have been inspired to become professional dancers. Perhaps not.\n\r\n\nBut one young woman said something else. She told me her ambition was to start a business, so she could create jobs in her local community.\n\r\n\nThe people in this hall who have started their own businesses will know how thrilling it is to take a risk and start something new.\n\r\n\nBut offering someone a job - creating opportunity for other people - is one of the most socially-responsible things you can do.\n\r\n\nIt is an act of public service as noble as any other. To everyone who has done it - we are all in your debt. So, we in this party, we in this hall, we say thank you.\n\r\n\nAnd to all businesses - large and small - you may have heard that there is a four-letter word to describe what we Conservatives want to do to you.\n\r\n\nIt has a single syllable. It is of Anglo-Saxon derivation. It ends in the letter 'K'.\n\r\n\nBack business.\n\r\n\nBack them to create jobs and build prosperity.\n\r\n\nBack them to drive innovation and improve lives.\n\r\n\nBack them with the lowest Corporation Tax in the G20.\n\r\n\nBritain, under my Conservative Government, is open for business.\n\r\n\r\n\nWe support free markets because we know their strengths.\n\r\n\nBut we also know their limits.\n\r\n\nThe defining event for a new generation of voters was not the fall of the Berlin Wall, but the collapse of the banks.\n\r\n\nIt was the biggest market failure in our lifetimes.\n\r\n\nA recession in which almost three quarters of a million jobs were lost.\n\r\n\nSound businesses forced to close because they could not access credit.\n\r\n\nPeople queuing to withdraw their money from Northern Rock.\n\r\n\nThanks to Labour, the country was not prepared.\n\r\n\nThe government ended up borrowing lb1 for every lb4 it spent.\n\r\n\nIt fell to our party to clear up the mess.\n\r\n\nEight years on, how have we done?\n\r\n\nOur economy is growing.\n\r\n\nThe deficit down by four-fifths.\n\r\n\nUnemployment at its lowest since the 1970s.\n\r\n\nYouth unemployment at a record low.\n\r\n\nHouseholds where nobody works down by almost a million.\n\r\n\nWe should not forget what's behind those numbers.\n\r\n\nThe parent who swaps a benefit cheque for a regular wage.\n\r\n\nThe youngster leaving school and never having to sign on.\n\r\n\nThe children growing up with an example of hard work.\n\r\n\nHope and dignity for millions of people in our country.\n\r\n\nWe should be proud of our record.\n\r\n\r\n\nBut our pride in those achievements should not blind us to the challenges that remain.\n\r\n\nThe after-effects of the crash are still being felt - in four important ways.\n\r\n\nSome markets are still not working in the interests of ordinary people.\n\r\n\nEmployment is up, but too many people haven't had a decent pay rise.\n\r\n\nThe deficit is down, but achieving that has been painful.\n\r\n\nAnd our economy is growing, but some communities have been left behind.\n\r\n\nThis is why some people still feel that our economy isn't working for them.\n\r\n\nOur mission as Conservatives must be to show them that we can build an economy that does.\n\r\n\nIn Liverpool last week, all Labour offered were bogus solutions that would make things worse.\n\r\n\nIdeas that might seem attractive at first glance, but which would hurt the very people they claim to help.\n\r\n\nTheir flagship announcement was a case in point.\n\r\n\nIt would mean the government effectively confiscating a tenth of every company with more than 250 employees.\n\r\n\nWorkers wouldn't become shareholders - and much of the income generated would end up with the government.\n\r\n\nThey dress it up as employee ownership, but it's a giant stealth tax on enterprise.\n\r\n\nIt would slash the share prices of British businesses, hitting anyone with a private pension.\n\r\n\r\n\nAnd it would make the UK an unattractive place to invest, driving away business, destroying jobs.\n\r\n\nThe same is true of their nationalisation policy.\n\r\n\nThey want our railways and utilities to be owned entirely by the Government.\n\r\n\nBut when you nationalise something, people pay for it twice - once when they use the service, and again every month through their taxes.\n\r\n\nAnd investment in them goes down, because when governments are setting budgets, they will always choose schools and hospitals over reservoirs and railways, so people get a worse service.\n\r\n\nEven some in the Labour Party admit their programme of nationalisation, and their endless expensive promises, would cost lb1 trillion.\n\r\n\nYou heard me right - one thousand billion pounds.\n\r\n\nThat is not government money but your money.\n\r\n\nBecause Labour would have to pay for it by raising taxes higher and higher.\n\r\n\nOf course, everyone should pay their fair share.\n\r\n\nBut when you raise taxes too high, businesses cannot afford to invest.\n\r\n\nThey cannot afford to take on new employees.\n\r\n\nEventually, they cannot afford to operate here at all.\n\r\n\nThey move abroad, create jobs in other countries, pay taxes somewhere else, and leave us poorer.\n\r\n\nThey would also have to increase borrowing again.\n\r\n\r\n\nWe already spend more each year on debt interest than we do on our schools.\n\r\n\nAfter all the sacrifices we have made, they would take us back to square one.\n\r\n\nThese ideas won't help people who are struggling, they will hurt them.\n\r\n\nHurt workers, whose jobs would go as businesses left Britain.\n\r\n\nHurt pensioners, whose savings would be devalued.\n\r\n\nAnd hurt young people, whose future Labour would mortgage.\n\r\n\nHowever bad the Labour approach is, we must do more than criticise it.\n\r\n\nWe need to show what this Conservative government is doing to address people's concerns.\n\r\n\nFirst, we need to make markets work in the interests of ordinary people again.\n\r\n\nThat's why we toughened up our corporate governance rules.\n\r\n\nWe are giving workers a stronger voice in the boardroom.\n\r\n\nWe have changed the rules on bonuses, so bosses are rewarded for long-term performance, not short-term profit.\n\r\n\nIt's why, with the gig economy changing how people work, we are changing our employment rules, so new technology cannot undermine workers' rights.\n\r\n\nIt's why we introduced the energy price cap.\n\r\n\nAnnounced at last year's conference, and in place for this winter.\n\r\n\nIt will stop energy firms charging their most loyal customers unfair prices.\n\r\n\nAny other companies charging their customers a 'loyalty penalty' should know: we will take action.\n\r\n\r\n\nBecause we put the interest of consumers first, we have also announced a fundamental review into our railways.\n\r\n\nSince privatisation, investment in the network has gone up, safety has improved, and more people are travelling by rail than ever before.\n\r\n\nBut on some routes the service has not been good enough. We will fix that.\n\r\n\nAnd while we do so, we will bring in a new system of auto-compensation, so that when your train is late you won't have to waste more time getting your money back.\n\r\n\nLast year I made it my personal mission to fix another broken market: housing.\n\r\n\nWe cannot make the case for capitalism if ordinary working people have no chance of owning capital.\n\r\n\nTo put the dream of home ownership back within their reach, we scrapped stamp duty for most first-time buyers - and over 120,000 households have already benefited.\n\r\n\nWe've helped half a million people onto the housing ladder through other schemes like Help to Buy.\n\r\n\nAnd this week we have announced that we will charge a higher rate of stamp duty on those buying homes who do not live and pay taxes in the UK, to help level the playing field for British buyers.\n\r\n\r\n\nThe money raised will go towards tackling the scourge of rough sleeping.\n\r\n\nBut the truth is that while these measures will help in the short term, we will only fix this broken market by building more homes.\n\r\n\nAnd that is what we are doing.\n\r\n\nMore new homes were added to our stock last year than in all but one of the last 30 years.\n\r\n\nBut we need to do better still.\n\r\n\nThe last time Britain was building enough homes - half a century ago - local councils made a big contribution.\n\r\n\nWe've opened-up the lb9 billion Affordable Housing Programme to councils, to get them building again.\n\r\n\nAnd at last year's conference I announced an additional lb2 billion for affordable housing.\n\r\n\nBut something is still holding many of them back.\n\r\n\nThere is a government cap on how much they can borrow against their Housing Revenue Account assets to fund new developments.\n\r\n\nSolving the housing crisis is the biggest domestic policy challenge of our generation.\n\r\n\nIt doesn't make sense to stop councils from playing their part in solving it.\n\r\n\nSo today I can announce that we are scrapping that cap.\n\r\n\nWe will help you get on the housing ladder.\n\r\n\nAnd we will build the homes this country needs.\n\r\n\r\n\nOur next challenge is to help working people with the cost of living.\n\r\n\nWe know how hard people work to make ends meet and provide for their families.\n\r\n\nIt isn't easy. It never has been.\n\r\n\nAnd the difference it makes to have a little bit of money left to put away at the end of each month isn't measured in pounds and pence.\n\r\n\nIt's the look on a daughter's face when her mum says she can have the bike she wants for her birthday.\n\r\n\nIt's the joy and precious memories that a week's holiday with the family brings.\n\r\n\nIt's the peace of mind that comes with having some savings.\n\r\n\nMany people, in towns and cities across our country, cannot take these things for granted.\n\r\n\nThey are the people this party exists for.\n\r\n\nThey are the people for whom this party must deliver.\n\r\n\nIt's for them that we cut income tax.\n\r\n\nIntroduced a National Living Wage.\n\r\n\nExtended free childcare.\n\r\n\nAnd froze fuel duty every year.\n\r\n\nBecause for millions of people, their car is not a luxury. It's a necessity.\n\r\n\nSome have wondered if there would be a thaw in our policy this year.\n\r\n\nToday I can confirm, given the high oil price, the Chancellor will freeze fuel duty once again in his budget later this month.\n\r\n\r\n\nMoney in the pockets of hard-working people.\n\r\n\nA Conservative Government that is on their side.\n\r\n\nThird, after a decade of austerity, people need to know that their hard work has paid off.\n\r\n\nBecause of that hard work, and the decisions taken by the Chancellor, our national debt is starting to fall for the first time in a generation.\n\r\n\nThis is a historic achievement.\n\r\n\nBut getting to this turning point wasn't easy.\n\r\n\nPublic sector workers had their wages frozen.\n\r\n\nLocal services had to do more with less.\n\r\n\nAnd families felt the squeeze.\n\r\n\nFixing our finances was necessary.\n\r\n\nThere must be no return to the uncontrolled borrowing of the past.\n\r\n\nNo undoing all the progress of the last eight years.\n\r\n\nNo taking Britain back to square one.\n\r\n\nBut the British people need to know that the end is in sight.\n\r\n\nAnd our message to them must be this: we get it.\n\r\n\nWe are not just a party to clean up a mess, we are the party to steer a course to a better future.\n\r\n\nSound finances are essential, but they are not the limit of our ambition.\n\r\n\nBecause you made sacrifices, there are better days ahead.\n\r\n\nSo, when we've secured a good Brexit deal for Britain, at the Spending Review next year we will set out our approach for the future.\n\r\n\r\n\nDebt as a share of the economy will continue to go down, support for public services will go up.\n\r\n\nBecause, a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off.\n\r\n\nThe final challenge is about the future we want for our economy.\n\r\n\nWe stand on the threshold of technological changes that will transform how we live and work, travel and communicate.\n\r\n\nThis has the potential to improve the lives of everyone in society, but only if we take the right decisions now.\n\r\n\nAt times of change in the past, the benefits have not been evenly spread.\n\r\n\nSome communities have been left behind. This time it must be different.\n\r\n\nBecause we are all worse off when any part of us is held back.\n\r\n\nThat means doing things differently.\n\r\n\nOur Modern Industrial Strategy is helping the whole country get ready for the economic change that is coming.\n\r\n\nWe are investing in infrastructure.\n\r\n\nWe are doing more than anyone since the Victorians to upgrade our railways.\n\r\n\nOur road-building programme is the largest since the 1970s.\n\r\n\nWe have taken the big decision to build a third runway at Heathrow.\n\r\n\r\n\nW\n\r\n\nWe are investing in our workforce - helping people train and retrain.\n\r\n\nIn our schools, we are keeping standards high.\n\r\n\nAnd where Labour want to roll-back reform, scrap academies and kill off free schools, we will build more of them, because every child deserves a great start in life.\n\r\n\nEvery child, in every town and city, across the whole country.\n\r\n\nSo that is our Conservative answer.\n\r\n\nFixing markets not destroying them.\n\r\n\nHelping with the cost of living.\n\r\n\nEnding austerity.\n\r\n\nAn economy of the future with nowhere left behind.\n\r\n\nThis is how we will build a country that works for everyone.\n\r\n\nI made that my mission when I stood for the leadership.\n\r\n\nIt was what I dedicated my government to on the steps of Downing Street.\n\r\n\nAnd it is the future this Party will deliver.\n\r\n\nEvery person in this hall has the power to shape that future.\n\r\n\nThis is a moment of opportunity for our party.\n\r\n\nTo champion decency in our politics.\n\r\n\nTo be the moderate, patriotic government this country needs.\n\r\n\nTo be a party not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules.\n\r\n\r\n\nAnd it's a moment of opportunity for our country.\n\r\n\r\n\nTo honour the result of the referendum.\n\r\n\nTo come together to make a success of the decision we took.\n\r\n\nTo build the homes we need.\n\r\n\nTo get the next generation on the housing ladder.\n\r\n\nTo help people who are struggling to make ends meet.\n\r\n\nTo invest in our vital public services.\n\r\n\nTo renew our precious National Health Service.\n\r\n\nTo lead the world in the technologies of the future.\n\r\n\nTo ensure every family and every community shares the success.\n\r\n\nTo tackle the burning injustices that hold people back.\n\r\n\nWe stand at a pivotal moment in our history.\n\r\n\nIt falls to our party to lead our country through it.\n\r\n\nWhen we come together there is no limit to what we can achieve.\n\r\n\nOurs is a great country. Our future is in our hands.\n\r\n\nTogether, let's seize it.\n\r\n\nTogether, let's build a better Britain.\n\r\n"
