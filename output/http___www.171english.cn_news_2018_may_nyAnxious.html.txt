"AMERICANS are a pretty anxious people. Nearly one in five of us — 18 percent — has an anxiety disorder. We spend over $2 billion a year on anti-anxiety medications. College students are often described as more stressed than ever before. There are many explanations for these nerves: a bad job market, less cohesive communities, the constant self-comparison that is social media. In 2002 the World Mental Health Survey found that Americans were the most anxious people in the 14 countries studied, with more clinically significant levels of anxiety than people in Nigeria, Lebanon and Ukraine.\r\n\r\n美国人非常容易焦虑。有近五分之一（18%）的美国人患有焦虑症。我们每年花在抗焦虑药物上的费用达到20亿美元（约合124亿人民币）。经常见到有人说，现在的大学生承受着空前的压力。对于这些焦虑的原因，有很多解释：糟糕的就业市场，社区凝聚力下降，因为使用社交媒体而进行持续的自我比照。2002年，世界心理健康调查(World Mental Health Survey)计划发现，在14个被调查国家中，美国人是最为焦虑的，达到临床显著水平的人群比尼日利亚、黎巴嫩和乌克兰都多。\r\n\r\nTo be clear, research suggests that anxiety is at least partially temperamental. A recent study of 592 rhesus monkeys found that some of them responded more anxiously than others and that as much as 30 percent of early anxiety may be inherited.\r\n\r\n需要明确的是，研究者认为焦虑的人至少部分具备喜怒无常的特征。最近一项对592只猕猴进行的研究显示，有些猕猴的焦虑反应比其他的要大，而有30%的早期焦虑症可能是遗传导致。\r\n\r\nYet what is inherited is the potential for anxiety, not anxiety itself. Life events obviously play a role. Another, less obvious factor may be the way we think about the mind: as an interior place that demands careful, constant attention.\r\n\r\n但是，遗传自父母的是焦虑的潜在可能，而非焦虑本身。生活中遭遇的事情显然会对引发焦虑起到一定作用。此外，相对不那么明显的影响因素可能还包括我们对心灵的认知：即把它看做一个需要小心和持续关注的内部所在。\r\n\r\nHumans seem to distinguish between mind and body in all cultures, but the sharp awareness of mind as a possession, distinct from soul and body, comes from the Enlightenment. It was then, in the aftermath of the crisis of religious authority and the scientific revolution, that there were intense debates about the nature of mental events. Between 1600 and 1815, the place where mental stuff happened — the “thing that thinks,” to use Descartes’s phrase — came to seem more and more important, as George Makari, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, explains in his forthcoming book, “Soul Machine: The Invention of the Modern Mind.”\r\n\r\n在所有文化中，人类似乎都会对身心加以相区别，但非常清晰地意识到心灵的存在、把它和灵魂与肉体相区别，是从启蒙运动时期开始。随着宗教权威遭遇挑战和科学革命诞生，当时出现了有关心灵本质的激烈辩论。1600年到1815年间，心智产生的地方——用笛卡尔的话说就是那个“会思考的东西”——似乎变得越来越重要。就像精神病医生和精神分析学家乔治·马卡里(George Makari)在其即将出版的著作《心灵机器：现代心智的诞生》(Soul Machine: The Invention of the Modern Mind)中所描述的。\r\n\r\n"
