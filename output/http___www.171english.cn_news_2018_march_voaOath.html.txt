However, early elections are also a possibility.\r\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said the United States looks forward to working with Vizcarra and praised Peru for its 鈥渃onstitutional transfer of power.鈥�\r\nPressure on Kuczynski increased this week after the emergence of secretly shot videos showing allies of Kuczynski allegedly attempting to buy the support of an opposition lawmaker to block the president鈥檚 impeachment.\r\nTo avoid impeachment, Kuczynski delivered a resignation letter to Congress Wednesday, blaming relentless attacks by his opponents for making it impossible to govern.\r\nCongress voted 105-12 on Friday to grant Kuczynski鈥檚 request to step down, but rejected his written arguments that he was doing so as a result of his opponents鈥� attacks. \r\nEfforts to oust Kuczynski have been led by Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of former Peruvian strongman Alberto Fujimori. Kuczynski has been accused of involvement in a bribery scandal related to his association with the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.\r\nKuczynski has vehemently denied having any business or political ties to the company. But documents presented by Keiko Fujimori's Popular Force party showed his consulting firm had received $782,000 in payments from Odebrecht a decade ago, some of them when he was a government minister.\r\nIn a plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department in December 2016, Odebrecht admitted to spreading $800 million in bribes to officials across Latin America, including $29 million in Peru."
