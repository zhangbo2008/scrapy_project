"Germans are renowned for their love of \nbeer\n, \nsausages\n and potato salad. But they also love \nKaffee und Kuchen\n (coffee and cake), a national afternoon ritual that can be traced back to the 17th Century when coffee beans were first imported to Europe.\nThese days, coffee and cake tends to be reserved for weekends, particularly on Sundays when shops are closed but bakeries and cafes are open. And while the tradition is no longer practised as diligently as it once was, it remains a key part of Germany’s gastronomic identity. Just like the British afternoon tea, it provides the opportunity to catch up with friends over an indulgent in-between-meal treat.\nThe baking repertoire in Germany is extensive, with a seasonal and regional focus and a strong appreciation for butter and cream. Classics include \nversunkener Apfelkuchen\n (sunken apple cake), \nMohnkuchen\n (poppy seed cake), \nStreuselkuchen\n (similar to a crumb cake) and \nRussischer Zupfkuchen \n(a combination of chocolate cake and cheesecake). You can find good cake across the country – but an excellent starting point is most certainly Munich.\n<!--\r\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-3135658776052410\";\r\n/* mingshi */\r\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"4998228531\";\r\ngoogle_ad_width = 336;\r\ngoogle_ad_height = 280;\r\n//-->\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nThat’s because since 2014, a social start-up known as \nKuchentratsch\n (cake and gossip) has been providing local cafes with sweet treats made by the best in the baking business: grandmothers. The idea was developed by business management graduate Katharina Mayer after she realised she couldn’t buy cakes as good as those made by her own ‘Oma’. She wanted a taste of home, something so delicious and comforting that calories simply didn’t matter. With this in mind, she came up with a business plan that combined many different ingredients: expert knowledge, local demand and support for potentially vulnerable people.\nAlongside cakes, Kuchentratsch provides an extra source of income and a novel meeting place for pensioners. It promotes intergenerational interaction and a sense of community, using flour, sugar and eggs as the glue. A younger team takes care of logistics, marketing, human resources and accounting, leaving the bakers free to sift, mix and whisk.\n“The conversations we have here are very different to those you tend to have with people your own age,” explained communications manager Theresa Offenbeck. “It makes you consider things from a different angle.”\nThe benefits for the older participants are also clear. Offenbeck described how one woman sees the kitchen as a form of therapy having worked in a factory her whole life, while another said it reconnects her to life and people.\nAll the baking takes place in a large workshop in the Munich district of Westend. Located on Landsberger Straße, a major road not far from the site of the city’s annual Oktoberfest, the creative space is an oasis among the trams, bikes and cars. In the entrance is a small cafe where passers-by can try a piece of cake along with a cup of tea or coffee. Offenbeck recommends visiting on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday morning, when the team will be in full swing, the hum of whirring machines and the smell of fresh baking filling the air.\nBakers have their own workspaces, and ahead of each shift they are given a list of cakes that need to be made that day, based on incoming orders. They make each one from start to finish. “We don’t want to create a production line,” Offenbeck said. “We want everyone to be in charge of their own work and time.” A typical shift involves five to six grandmothers, who bake an average of 50 cakes in total, Offenbeck explained. This is an impressive number, particularly as some prefer to do everything by hand.\nThe cakes are based on the grandmothers’ own recipes, many of them handed down from the handwritten, sometimes tattered, recipe books of their own mothers or grandmothers. The most popular with customers is currently Oma Irmgard’s carrot cake, which is made with large amounts of freshly grated carrot (piles of which can be spotted across the kitchen) and topped with some of the best cream-cheese icing you’ll ever try.\n“We make it so often, I can’t really eat it anymore!” Oma Irmgard joked. “I prefer a slice of sour cherry tart.”\nIt’s clear to see Oma Irmgard was a professional: having run cooking courses for many years, she works quickly and confidently, keeping an eye on the rest of the kitchen at the same time.\nAnother popular order is Oma Milena’s \nMarmorkuchen\n (marble cake). This timeless German favourite is made by swirling layers of chocolate and vanilla sponge mix in a round \nKugelhopf\n (Bundt) tin before baking. Getting the perfect swirl is no easy feat, however, with the Kuchentratsch bakers offering diverse techniques and tips for getting it just right.\nOnce cooled, decorated and packaged, the sweet parcels are delivered to cafes, offices and events by a number of drivers, many of whom are also retired local residents. The oldest is 87-year-old Opa Richard (everyone is referred to as Oma or Opa at Kuchentratsch). “Opa Richard likes to arrive at work ahead of his shift,” Offenbeck explained. “That way he can have a piece of cake and a chat before hitting the road. We hear him coming thanks to the swing music blasting from his car!”\nOn Opa Richard’s drop-off list are a number of regular cafes. These include renovated baroque villa \nBamberger Haus\n in Schwabing and \nCafé Mon\n in Bogenhausen. Another is \nMonaco Café\n, located in a large department store on the corner of Marienplatz. With views over the city’s central square, Monaco Café is a great spot to refuel, get your bearings and watch people gather in front of the famous town hall below.\nA particular highlight is \nCafé Schreibwaren am Schloss\n. Located in a lovingly restored historical building close to the \nNymphenburg Palace\n, this place continues the generational theme: the small cafe is a converted \nSchreibwaren\n (stationery) store that belonged to the grandfather and great grandfather of the current managers. Look out for a yellow building with blue and white shutters.\nOpa Richard isn’t the only grandfather involved in Kuchentratsch. Two more help with the deliveries, while a few others have turned their hand to baking. After the death of his wife, Opa Günter decided to teach himself to cook so he could continue making much-loved family recipes for his grandchildren. His rhubarb and coconut cake is now a big hit. “I used to just eat cake, now I make it, too!” he said, wearing his Kuchentratsch cap backwards.\nJust like Opa Günter, Kuchentratsch wants to keep old recipes alive. To ensure precious knowledge and skill are not lost, the team has produced \ntwo cookbooks\n and documented every recipe they work with – preserving them for generations to come. With more than 30 senior citizens currently involved, and the cakes in high demand, business is most certainly (excuse the pun) on the rise.\n德国人对啤酒、香肠和土豆沙拉的喜爱世界闻名，咖啡和蛋糕也受到他们的钟爱。对他们来说，这是属于整个民族的午后仪式，可以追溯到17世纪，当时欧洲首次进口咖啡豆。\n如今，人们一般在周末享用咖啡和蛋糕，尤其是在所有商店都关门，只有面包店和咖啡馆开门的周日。虽然人们不再像以前那样严格遵守这项传统，但它仍是德国美食的重要组成部分。和英国的下午茶一样，它为朋友之间的聚会闲聊提供了机会，可以放纵享受美食。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    享用咖啡和蛋糕是德国一种仪式，可以追溯到17世纪。\r\n                \n德国人的烘焙产品种类繁多，季节和区域特点突出，尤其喜欢黄油和奶油。经典作品包括versunkener Apfelkuchen(凹苹果蛋糕)、Mohnkuchen(罂粟籽蛋糕)、Streuselkuchen(类似于面包屑蛋糕)和Russischer Zupfkuchen(巧克力蛋糕和芝士蛋糕的结合体)。在德国各地，都能找到美味的蛋糕，但第一站一定要去慕尼黑。\n这是因为，自2014年以来，一家名为“蛋糕&闲话”(Kuchentratsch)的初创企业一直在为当地的咖啡馆提供烘焙行业中最好的产品——祖母制作的甜点。梅耶（Katharina Mayer）毕业于工商管理专业，意识到自己再也吃不到像奶奶做的那样美味的蛋糕后，她提出了这个创意。她想要一种家的味道，一种吃起来美味又舒心的食物，卡路里在这面前根本不重要。她将这一点铭记于心，拟出了一份结合许多不同元素的商业计划书，包括专家知识、当地需求和对潜在弱势群体的支持。\n除了蛋糕，“蛋糕&闲话”还为退休人员提供了额外的收入来源和新奇的聚会场所。面粉、糖和鸡蛋像“粘合剂”一样，把两代人揉在一起，互动更多，社区意识更浓。年轻人的团队负责后勤、营销、人力资源和会计，面包师得以随心所欲地过滤、混合和搅拌。\n公关经理奥芬贝克（Offenbeck）解释说：“在这里，我们之间的谈话和与同龄人之间谈话截然不同。它让你从不同的角度考虑问题。”\n\r\n\n\r\n                    自2014年以来，\"蛋糕&闲话\"一直向慕尼黑的咖啡馆供应当地老人制作的蛋糕。\r\n                \n雇佣老人的好处显而易见。奥芬贝克讲述了其中几人：一位老奶奶一生都在工厂工作，她将厨房视为一种治疗方式；另一位则说厨房帮助她重新与日常生活及他人建立了联系。\n所有的烘焙工作都在慕尼黑的西区完成。这个创意空间像一片绿洲，坐落于川流不息的兰茨贝格大街，一条离每年慕尼黑啤酒节不远的主干道。入口处是一间小咖啡馆，路人可以在这里品尝蛋糕、茶或咖啡。奥芬贝克建议大家最好在周一、三、五的早上来这里，那时制作团队火力全开，机器高速运转，空气中弥漫着蛋糕新鲜出炉的香气。\n面包师有自己的工作空间。每次换班前，他们都会根据收到的订单列出当天需要制作的蛋糕清单，以确保制作时一个不漏。奥芬贝克说：“我们希望每个人都能对自己的工作和时间负责，并不想建立流水生产线。”奥芬贝克解释说，一般轮班包括5到6位祖母，平均每人烤50个蛋糕。这个数字令人钦佩，尤其是对于喜欢手工完成所有事情的人来说。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    梅耶(右)在意识到买不到像她祖母做的那样好的蛋糕后创立了\"蛋糕&闲话\"。\r\n                \n这些蛋糕是按照祖母们自己的秘方制作而成，其中很多食谱是由祖母们手写，世代相传，有些甚至都磨破了。目前，伊姆加德（Irmgard）奶奶的胡萝卜蛋糕最受欢迎。它用大量新鲜磨碎的胡萝卜制成(在厨房里可以看到成堆的胡萝卜)，上面覆盖着一层奶油奶酪糖霜，这可能是能吃到的品质最好的糖霜。\n“做得太多，我一点都不想吃了！”伊姆加德奶奶开玩笑说，“我宁愿吃一片酸樱桃馅饼。”\n伊姆加德奶奶已经开设了多年的烹饪课程，显然十分内行。她工作时不仅利落且自信，还随时留意着厨房里的动向。\n米莱娜（Milena）奶奶的大理石蛋糕(Marmorkuchen)也很受欢迎。这款永不过时的德国美食将巧克力和香草海绵蛋糕放在在圆形的烤盘里搅拌制成。然而，要得到完美的漩涡并非易事，“蛋糕&闲话”的烘焙师们为此想出了各种各样的技巧。\n这些甜蜜的包裹经过冷却、装饰和包装等步骤后就会由骑手们送到咖啡馆、办公室和活动现场，其中许多骑手也是当地的退休居民。最年长的是87岁的理查德（Richard）爷爷(在\"蛋糕&闲话\"每个人都被称为奶奶或爷爷)。奥芬贝克解释说：“理查德喜欢提前上班。这样他在工作前能吃块蛋糕，聊聊天。每次听到外面的车里传来摇摆舞音乐，我们就知道是理查德爷爷来了!”\n理查德爷爷的送货名单上有很多普通咖啡馆，包括位于施瓦宾的巴洛克式别墅班贝格尔小屋（Bamberger Haus）和博根豪森的Mon咖啡馆。还有一家是摩纳哥咖啡馆，位于马里恩广场(Marienplatz)一角的大型百货公司中。这个咖啡馆是一个补充能量的好地方，在此可以辨明自己的方位，俯瞰城市中心广场的景色、聚集在著名的市政厅前的人潮。\n宁芬堡宫(Nymphenburg Palace)附近有一家文具城堡咖啡馆（Schreibwaren am Schloss），也很值得一提。它位于一幢精心修复的历史建筑中，由一家文具店改造而成，现任老板从祖父及曾祖父手中接过来，可谓代代传承。想来探店的人，就找找装有蓝色和白色百叶窗的黄色建筑。\n\r\n\n\r\n                    \"蛋糕&闲话\"为退休人员提供了额外的收入来源，还增强了社区意识。\r\n                \n理查德并不是“蛋糕&闲话”里唯一的一位爷爷，有另外两名骑手爷爷帮忙送餐，还有一些爷爷开始着手做蛋糕。妻子去世后，甘特（Günter）爷爷决定自学烹饪，这样他就可以继续为孙子们制作深受喜爱的家庭美食。他做的大黄椰子蛋糕现在很受欢迎。反戴着\"蛋糕&闲话\"帽子的甘特爷爷说：“过去我只负责吃，现在我自己做蛋糕！”\n和甘特爷爷一样，“蛋糕&闲话”希望保留旧食谱。为了确保这些宝贵的知识和技能不会消失，该团队制作了两本烹饪书，将他们使用的每一种食谱都记录了下来，传给下一代。目前，有30多名老年人参与其中，且蛋糕需求量很大，这门生意肯定会越来越好。\n\r\n\r\n\nGermans are renowned for their love of \nbeer\n, \nsausages\n and potato salad.
