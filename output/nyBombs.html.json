The mailing labels were computer-printed, and six first-class stamps were affixed to all of the envelopes.\r\n\n联邦调查局称，所有的包裹都装在信封里，里面垫着泡沫塑料包装，寄回地址写着黛比·瓦瑟曼·舒尔茨(Debbie Wasserman Schultz)的名字，她是佛罗里达州议员和前民主党全国委员会主席。邮寄标签是用电脑打印的，所有信封上都贴有六张一等邮票。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n其中一个简易炸弹的X光片。\n\r\nA fifth device sent to Mr. Obama’s attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., was apparently incorrectly addressed, and because Ms. Wasserman Schultz’s name was on the return address, it was ultimately delivered to her district office in Florida, the F.B.I. said.\r\n\n联邦调查局称，寄给奥巴马的司法部长小埃里克·H·霍尔德(Eric H. Holder Jr.)的第五个装置显然写错了地址，由于寄回地址上写的是瓦瑟曼·舒尔茨的名字，它最终被送到她在佛罗里达州的办公室。\r\n\nAnother package addressed to Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, was intercepted at a Congressional mail facility, Ms. Waters said in a statement. In recent months, Mr. Trump and Ms. Waters have often ridiculed each other.\r\n\n还有一个写有加利福尼亚州民主党众议员玛克辛·沃特斯(Maxine Waters)地址的包裹，被国会邮件部门截获。最近几个月，特朗普和沃特斯经常互相嘲讽。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n纽约曼哈顿，CNN办公室被警察疏散。\n\r\nThe device that went to CNN’s offices arrived by courier, a law enforcement official said. However, it still had half-a-dozen first-class postage stamps on it. Investigators believe the bomb delivered to Mr. Soros’s home was dropped off in his mailbox.\r\n\n一名执法官员说，寄往CNN办公室的装置是通过信差送到的。然而，它上面仍然贴有六张一等的邮票。调查人员认为，送到索罗斯家中的炸弹是放在他的邮箱里的。\r\n\nThe device sent to Mrs. Clinton was found late Tuesday by a Secret Service employee who screens mail for her, a statement from the Secret Service said.\r\n\n特勤局的一份声明称，送给克林顿的装置于周二晚些时候被一位负责为她筛选邮件的特勤局员工发现。\r\n\nA security guard at the Clinton Foundation’s Midtown Manhattan offices said the package was addressed to Mrs. Clinton’s home in Westchester County, north of New York City, not her offices.\r\n\n克林顿基金会曼哈顿中城办公室的一名保安说，这个包裹是寄往克林顿在纽约市北部韦斯特切斯特县的家，而不是她的办公室。\r\n\nThe package addressed to Mr. Obama was intercepted early Wednesday by Secret Service personnel in Washington.\r\n\n星期三早些时候，华盛顿的特勤局人员截获了寄给奥巴马的包裹。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n一个爆炸装置的X光片。\n\r\nThe devices were constructed with a 1-inch-by-6-inch length of PVC pipe filled with suspected pyrotechnic powder and broken glass to serve as shrapnel, a law enforcement official said.\r\n\n一名执法官员说，这些装置是由1英寸（约合2.5厘米）×6英寸（约合15厘米）的聚氯乙烯管制成，其中装有可疑的烟火粉末和作为弹片的碎玻璃。\r\n\nThe power source was a button battery, with a digital clock as a timer, the official said.\r\n\n该官员说，电源是纽扣电池，还有一个电子钟作为定时器。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nA senior law enforcement official in New York, describing the bomb sent to CNN, said it was intercepted in the basement mailroom and resembled the others: “Same package. Same device.”\r\n\n纽约的一名高级执法官员描述了发送给CNN的炸弹，称其在地下的收发室截获，而且它与其他炸弹类似：“同样的包裹。同样的装置。”\r\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, New York City’s police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said that the CNN bomb was “a live explosive device” and that it would be rendered harmless and sent to the F.B.I. to be analyzed. The package that contained the device also included white powder that the police were testing to determine if it was toxic, he said.\r\n\n周三下午，纽约市警察专员詹姆斯·P·奥尼尔(James P. O’Neill)说，寄往CNN的炸弹是“一个能用的爆炸装置”，将对它做无危害处理，并送到联邦调查局进行分析。他说，该装置的包裹中还包含白色粉末，警方目前正在测试，以确定它是否有毒。\r\n\nSome bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested that the bomb sent to CNN had hallmarks of fake explosives — the kind more typically depicted on television and in movies, rather than devices capable of detonating.\r\n\n一些炸弹专家研究了社交媒体上传播的爆炸装置照片后表示，寄给CNN的炸弹有假炸弹的特征——这种爆炸物通常出现在电视和电影里，不是能够真正引爆的装置。\r\n\nA digital clock was taped to the middle of the pipe, a feature that experts say is typically shown on fictional bombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension, but unnecessary in real life.\r\n\n一个电子计时器贴在管子中间，专家说这个特征通常出现在假炸弹上，试图加剧戏剧性的紧张气氛，但在现实生活中是不必要的。\r\n\nIn fact, bombmakers generally avoid attaching visible clocks to their devices to keep from tipping off their targets about when the bombs are set to explode.\r\n\n实际上，炸弹制造者通常避免将可见的时钟连接到装置上，以防在炸弹爆炸时提醒目标。\r\n\nEarlier this month, federal authorities said they intercepted multiple packages suspected of containing the lethal substance ricin, addressed to Mr. Trump and at least two top Pentagon officials. In February, an envelope containing a white, powdery substance that investigators later determined was cornstarch was sent to the Manhattan apartment of Donald Trump Jr.’s mother-in-law.\r\n\n本月早些时候，联邦当局表示，他们拦截了多起涉嫌含有致命物质蓖麻毒素的包裹，它们是寄给特朗普和至少两名五角大楼高级官员的。今年2月，一个装有白色粉状物质的信封送到小唐纳德·特朗普的岳母在曼哈顿的公寓，调查人员后来确定该物质为玉米淀粉。\r\n\n翻译：纽约时报中文网\r\n"
