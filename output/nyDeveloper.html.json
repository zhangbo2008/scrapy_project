In 2014 the brothers reached a settlement to divide the family trust that controls Sun Hung Kai, which was valued at more than $33 billion.\r\n\n公司董事会投票决定将他解职，由他的母亲接任董事长。2014年，三兄弟达成和解协议，分割控制新鸿基价值超过330亿美元的家族信托。\r\n\nMr. Kwok had recently tried to renegotiate that settlement, arguing that the properties he received had not appreciated as quickly as those of his brothers.\r\n\n前不久，郭炳湘试图重新谈判这项和解协议，认为他收到的财产没有像他弟弟的财产那样迅速升值。\r\n\nMr. Kwok remained a nonexecutive board member until 2014. He also founded his own development company, Empire Group Holdings.\r\n\n郭炳湘在2014年之前一直担任非执行董事会成员。他还创立了自己的开发公司帝国集团。\r\n\nMr. Kwok’s brothers were charged in a bribery scandal in 2012 that led to the imprisonment of Rafael Hui, who had been the second-highest official in Hong Kong’s government. The case was touched off by an anonymous letter received by Hong Kong’s anticorruption agency at the end of 2008.\r\n\n郭的弟弟们于2012年因贿赂丑闻而受到指控，该丑闻导致曾任香港政府第二高官的许仕仁入狱。香港反贪机构于2008年底收到一封匿名信，引发了此案。\r\n\nThomas Kwok was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for paying more than $1 million and providing other benefits to Mr. Hui. Raymond Kwok was acquitted.\r\n\n郭炳江因向许仕仁提供超过100万美元以及其他好处而被定罪，判处五年徒刑。郭炳联被无罪释放。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nWalter Kwok, who was arrested but never charged in the case, sought to distance himself from the scandal, saying he had not been involved in employing Mr. Hui. The family conflict prompted speculation in Hong Kong that he had tipped off the authorities about the bribery, but such a link was never proved.\r\n\n郭炳湘当时也被逮捕，但从未受到指控，他试图与丑闻保持距离，称他没有参与雇用许仕仁。这起家庭冲突在香港引发了猜测，认为他曾向当局透露过贿赂行为，但这种联系从未得到证实。\r\n\nBesides his wife, Mr. Kwok is survived by his two brothers and three children.\r\n\n除了他的妻子，郭炳湘在世的亲人还包括两个弟弟和三个儿女。\r\n\n王霜舟(Austin Ramzy)是《纽约时报》驻香港记者。\r\n\r\n\n翻译：晋其角\r\n"
