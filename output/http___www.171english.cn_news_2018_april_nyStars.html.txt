"Onstage, South Korean K-Pop Stars. In the Balcony, Kim Jong-un, Clapping.\r\nSEOUL, South Korea 鈥� He clapped and he smiled, even posing for a group photo with a K-pop band.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance by North Korea鈥檚 leader, Kim Jong Un, on Sunday at a concert by South Korean musicians in Pyongyang was all the more unusual because his authoritarian government has been struggling to stave off what it sees as an infiltration of the South鈥檚 pop culture among his isolated people.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Kim shook the hands of members of South Korea鈥檚 most popular girl band, Red Velvet, which he and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, watched from a balcony.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter watching Red Velvet perform, Kim reportedly pronounced the event a 鈥済ift for Pyongyang citizens.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two-hour show at the East Pyongyang Grand Theater was part of a political d茅tente between the neighboring countries as relations have thawed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the first time a North Korean leader watched a South Korean musical performance in the North鈥檚 capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe performances by the South Korean troupe that flew in Saturday with great fanfare to Pyongyang were done in the name of international diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe show occurred just weeks before Kim is scheduled to meet with South Korea鈥檚 president, Moon Jae-in, at a border village on April 27, and before a planned summit meeting with President Donald Trump in May.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were the first South Korean singers to perform in North Korea in more than a decade. Their visit reciprocated a North Korean art troupe鈥檚 performances in South Korea during its Winter Olympics in February. Moon watched one of the North Korean performances.\r\n\r\n\r\nKim and Ri, a former singer, were among hundreds of North Koreans who filled the 1,500-seat theater to watch the South Korean singers, including older crooners, gelled rockers and K-pop starlets.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday evening, thunderous clapping erupted when Kim and his wife entered the concert hall and seated themselves in a second-floor balcony, according to pool reports from South Korean journalists and officials.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention was focused on how Kim would react to the pop singers, particularly Red Velvet. The five-member girl group is typical of South Korean girl groups 鈥� known for their chirpy, bubble-gum harmonies and sexy choreography.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir tunes are so infectious that the South Korean military has broadcast them across the border in a psychological war against North Korean soldiers. The North used to threaten to direct its artillery at the loudspeakers, warning of an 鈥渁ll-out war鈥� if the South didn鈥檛 turn them off.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow things have changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Korean officials said the North did not attempt to reject any of the South Korean song lineup or change the pop stars鈥� lyrics or risqu茅 dance moves.\r\n\r\n\r\n(But apparently, even North Korea had a limit to how far it would go in accepting K-pop. South Korean officials said the North had rejected their suggestion that the global star Psy, the singer famous for his 鈥淕angnam Style鈥� global hit, be included in the visit.)\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥淧lease tell President Moon how good this kind of exchange is. I know there has been attention to whether I will come and see Red Velvet,鈥� Kim was quoted as telling South Korean officials. 鈥淚 thank you for bringing this gift to Pyongyang citizens.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nKim Yerim, a Red Velvet member who is known as Yeri, was quoted as saying, 鈥淭he audience clapped loudly and even sang along.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South Korean culture minister, Do Jong-hwan, told reporters in Pyongyang after the show that Kim 鈥渟howed much interest during the show and asked questions about the songs and lyrics.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nKim鈥檚 acceptance of Red Velvet and South Korean pop culture was striking because his government has stepped up a crackdown on DVDs and computer thumb drives containing South Korean pop songs, movies and TV dramas smuggled from China, calling for establishing 鈥渕osquito nets鈥� to keep out 鈥渄ecadent capitalist influence.鈥�\r\n\r\n\r\nDefectors from the North have said that those who were caught selling or watching South Korean K-pop music videos could be sent to prison camps.\r\n\r\n\r\nKim, who studied in Switzerland as a teenager, has tried of late to present himself as more flexible, at least among the loyal elite citizens living in Pyongyang. North Korea鈥檚 Moranbong Band, often said to be Kim鈥檚 favorite girl group, has performed in short skirts and high heels, featuring theme songs from Hollywood films.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South Korean singers now in the North will hold a joint concert with North Korean performers Tuesday at an indoor stadium in Pyongyang.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Koreans will see a recorded version of the concert later this week, according to local news media. It鈥檚 unclear if, or when, ordinary North Koreans will be allowed to see it.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�2鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圕HOE SANG-HUN锛�\r\n闊╁浗棣栧皵鈥斺�斾粬榧撴帉锛屼粬寰瑧锛屼粬鐢氳嚦鎽嗗ソ濮垮娍鍜屼竴涓煩鍥芥祦琛屼箰闃熷悎鐓с��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍛ㄦ棩鍦ㄥ钩澹や妇琛岀殑涓�鍦洪煩鍥借壓浜烘紨鍞变細涓婏紝鏈濋矞棰嗗浜洪噾姝ｆ仼鐨勯湶闈㈠緢涓嶅甯革紝鍥犱负浠栫殑涓撳埗鏀垮簻涓�鐩村湪鍔姏闃绘闊╁浗娴佽闊充箰鏂囧寲瀵逛笌涓栭殧缁濈殑鏈濋矞姘戜紬鐨勬笚閫忚抗璞°��\r\n\r\n\r\n浣嗛噾姝ｆ仼涓庨煩鍥芥渶鍙楁杩庣殑濂冲瓙涔愬洟鈥滅孩涓濈粧鈥�(Red Velvet)鐨勬垚鍛樹滑鎻′簡鎵嬶紝浠栧拰濡诲瓙鏉庨洩涓�(Ri Sol Ju)涓�璧峰湪鍖呭帰涓鐪嬩簡濂逛滑鐨勮〃婕斻��\r\n\r\n\r\n鎹О锛屽湪鐪嬪畬鈥滅孩涓濈粧鈥濈殑琛ㄦ紨鍚庯紝閲戞鎭╁鍛婅繖娆℃椿鍔ㄦ槸鈥滅粰骞冲￥浜烘皯鐨勭ぜ鐗┾�濄��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍙充笂瑙掗湶鍙颁笂鐨勬湞椴滈瀵间汉閲戞鎭┿�傚懆鏃ワ紝浠栧湪骞冲￥闊╁浗鑹轰汉婕斿嚭涓婄殑闇查潰寮曟潵浜嗛浄楦ｈ埇鐨勬帉澹般��\r\n\r\n\r\n闅忕潃涓や釜閭诲浗涔嬮棿鍏崇郴瑙ｅ喕锛岃繖鍦哄湪涓滃钩澹ゅぇ鍓у満(East Pyongyang Grand Theatre)杩涜鐨勪袱灏忔椂婕斿嚭鏄斂娌诲拰瑙ｇ殑涓�閮ㄥ垎銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欐槸鏈濋矞棰嗗浜洪娆″湪鏈濋矞棣栭兘瑙傜湅闊╁浗闊充箰婕斿嚭銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欎簺闊╁浗涔愬洟鍦ㄥ钩澹ゅ緱鍒颁簡澶ц倖瀹ｆ壃锛屼粬浠簬鍛ㄥ叚椋炴姷骞冲￥锛岃繖娆¤〃婕旀槸浠ュ浗闄呭浜ょ殑鍚嶄箟杩涜鐨勩��\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欏満婕斿嚭鍑犲懆涔嬪悗锛屾寜鐓ц鍒掞紝閲戞鎭╁氨灏嗕簬4鏈�27鏃ュ湪涓�涓竟澧冩潙搴勪細瑙侀煩鍥芥�荤粺鏂囧湪瀵咃紝骞跺皢浜�5鏈堜笌鍞愮撼寰仿风壒鏈楁櫘鎬荤粺涓捐棰嗗浜轰細鏅ゃ��\r\n\r\n\r\n闊╁浗姝屾墜璧靛寮�(Cho Yong-pil)鍦ㄦ紨鍑哄墠杩涜鎺掔粌銆�\r\n\r\n浠栦滑鏄崄鍑犲勾鏉ラ娆″湪鏈濋矞琛ㄦ紨鐨勯煩鍥芥瓕鎵嬨�傝繖娆¤闂槸瀵规湞椴滆壓鏈洟2鏈堝湪鍐ゥ浼氭湡闂存紨鍑虹殑鍥炲簲锛屽綋鏃舵枃鍦ㄥ瘏瑙傜湅浜嗘湞椴滆壓鏈洟鐨勪竴鍦烘紨鍑恒��\r\n\r\n\r\n閲戞鎭╁拰鏇剧粡褰撹繃姝屾墜鐨勬潕闆富锛屼互鍙婂潗婊′簡杩欎釜鑳藉绾�1500浜虹殑鍓ч櫌鐨勬湞椴滀汉涓�璧疯鐪嬩簡闊╁浗姝屾墜浠殑婕斿嚭锛屾紨鍑洪樀瀹瑰寘鎷緝骞撮暱鐨勬儏姝屾瓕鎵嬨�佹姽浜嗗彂鑳剁殑鎽囨粴姝屾墜鍜屽勾杞荤殑闊╁浗娴佽濂虫瓕鎵嬨��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏍规嵁闊╁浗璁拌�呭拰瀹樺憳鐨勫悇绉嶆姤閬擄紝鍛ㄦ棩鏅氫笂锛屽綋閲戞鎭╁拰濡诲瓙璧拌繘闊充箰鍘咃紝鍦ㄤ簩妤煎寘鍘㈠叆搴ф椂锛屽墽鍦轰腑鎺屽０闆峰姩銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浜轰滑鐨勬敞鎰忓姏閮介泦涓湪閲戞鎭╁娴佽姝屾墜鐨勫弽搴斾笂锛屽挨鍏舵槸鈥滅孩涓濈粧鈥濄�傝繖涓簲浜哄コ瀛愮粍鍚堟槸鍏稿瀷鐨勯煩鍥藉コ鍥⑩�斺�斾互娆㈠揩鐢滅編鐨勫拰澹颁笌鎬ф劅鐨勭紪鑸炶憲鍚嶃��\r\n\r\n\r\n濂逛滑鐨勬洸璋冨緢鏈夋劅鏌撳姏锛屼互鑷充簬闊╁浗鍐涢槦浼氬啿鐫�杈瑰閭ｄ竴杈瑰箍鎾ス浠殑闊充箰锛屼綔涓哄鏈濋矞澹叺鐨勫績鐞嗘垬銆傛湞椴滄浘缁忓▉鑳佽鎶婂ぇ鐐瀯鍑嗘壃澹板櫒锛屽鏋滈煩鍥戒笉鍏虫帀闊充箰锛屼粬浠細鍙戝姩涓�鍦衡�滃叏闈㈡垬浜夆�濄��\r\n\r\n\r\n杩欐槸鎬庢牱鐨勪竴绉嶆椂杩囧杩併��\r\n\r\n\r\n闊╁浗瀹樺憳琛ㄧず锛屾湞椴滀粠鏈瘯鍥炬嫆缁濋煩鍥藉畨鎺掔殑浠讳綍姝屾洸鑺傜洰锛屾垨鑰呮槸鏀瑰姩娴佽鏄庢槦鐨勬瓕璇嶄互鍙婃湁浼ら鍖栫殑鑸炶箞鍔ㄤ綔銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n锛堜絾鏄樉鐒讹紝灏辫繛鏈濋矞瀵归煩鍥芥祦琛岄煶涔愮殑鎺ュ彈绋嬪害閮芥槸鏈夐檺鐨勩�傞煩鍥藉畼鍛樿〃绀猴紝鏈濋矞鎷掔粷浜嗕粬浠鎶婂叏鐞冩槑鏄熴�佺幆鐞冪儹闂ㄦ瓕鏇层�婃睙鍗桽tyle銆嬬殑婕斿敱鑰匬sy鍔犲叆璁块棶鍚嶅崟鐨勬彁璁�傦級\r\n\r\n\r\n鈥滆甯垜杞憡鏂囨�荤粺锛岃繖鏍风殑浜ゆ祦闈炲父濂姐�傛垜鐭ラ亾浜轰滑鍦ㄥ叧娉ㄦ垜鏄惁浼氭潵鐪嬧�樼孩涓濈粧鈥欒〃婕旓紝鈥濇湁浜哄紩杩伴噾姝ｆ仼瀵归煩鍥藉畼鍛樿銆傗�滄劅璋綘浠负骞冲￥浜烘皯甯︽潵浜嗚繖鏍风殑绀肩墿銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏈変汉寮曡堪鑹哄悕涓篩eri鐨勨�滅孩涓濈粧鈥濇垚鍛橀噾鑹虹惓(Kim Yerim)琚锛屸�滆浼楀ぇ澹板湴榧撴帉锛岃繕涓�璧峰悎鍞便�傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n婕斿嚭缁撴潫鍚庯紝闊╁浗鏂囧寲閮ㄩ儴闀块兘閽熺剷(Do Jong-hwan)鍦ㄥ钩澹ゅ憡璇夎鑰咃紝閲戞鎭┾�滃湪婕斿嚭鏈熼棿灞曠幇鍑轰簡寰堝ぇ鍏磋叮锛岃繕闂簡鏈夊叧姝屾洸鍜屾瓕璇嶇殑闂銆傗��\r\n\r\n\r\n閲戞鎭╁鈥滅孩涓濈粧鈥濆拰闊╁浗娴佽闊充箰鏂囧寲鐨勬帴鍙椾护浜洪渿鎯婏紝鍥犱负浠栫殑鏀垮簻姝ｅ湪鍔犵揣鎵撳嚮浠庝腑鍥借蛋绉佺殑锛屽惈鏈夐煩鍥芥祦琛屾瓕鏇层�佺數褰卞拰鐢佃鍓х殑DVD鍜岀數鑴戦棯瀛橈紝鍛煎悂寤虹珛鈥滆殜甯愨�濓紝闃绘鈥滆厫鏈界殑璧勬湰涓讳箟褰卞搷鈥濄��\r\n\r\n\r\n鏉ヨ嚜鏈濋矞鐨勮劚鍖楄�呰〃绀猴紝璐╁崠鎴栬鐪嬮煩鍥芥祦琛岄煶涔愯棰戣鎹曠殑浜哄彲鑳戒細琚�佸線闆嗕腑钀ャ��\r\n\r\n\r\n灏戝勾鏃舵浘鍦ㄧ憺澹暀瀛︾殑閲戞鎭╄繎鏉ヨ瘯鍥惧睍鐜拌嚜宸辨洿鍔犲彉閫氱殑褰㈣薄锛岃嚦灏戞槸瀵归偅浜涘钩澹ょ殑蹇犺瘹涓婂眰鍏皯浠�備汉浠父璇存湞椴滅殑鐗′腹宄颁箰鍥�(Moranbong Band)鏄噾姝ｆ仼鏈�鍠滅埍鐨勫コ瀛愪箰鍥紝濂逛滑鏇剧┛鐭鍜岄珮璺熼瀷婕斿嚭锛岃〃婕斿ソ鑾卞潪鐢靛奖鐨勪富棰樻洸銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鍛ㄤ簩锛岃繖浜涚洰鍓嶆鍦ㄦ湞椴滄紨鍑虹殑闊╁浗姝屾墜灏嗗湪骞冲￥涓�涓鍐呬綋鑲查鍐呬笌鏈濋矞琛ㄦ紨鑰呬妇鍔炶仈鍚堟紨鍑恒��\r\n\r\n\r\n鎹綋鍦版柊闂诲獟浣撴姤閬擄紝闊╁浗浜哄皢鍦ㄦ湰鍛ㄦ櫄浜涙椂鍊欑湅鍒伴煶涔愪細鐨勫綍鍒剁増鏈�傛櫘閫氱殑鏈濋矞浜烘槸鍚︿細琚厑璁革紝鎴栨槸浣曟椂浼氳鍏佽瑙傜湅锛岀洰鍓嶅皻涓嶆竻妤氥��\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氱航绾︽椂鎶ヤ腑鏂囩綉"
