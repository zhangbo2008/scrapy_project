"By Sarah Keating ; 5 April,2018\r\nI’d only been in Singapore a few months when I had my first experience of kiasuism. It was a Saturday afternoon and after a couple of hours exploring the shopping area of Orchard Road in the dense, heavy heat, I headed to the MRT (train) station weighed down with a pushchair and two tired children ready to go home.\r\nThe station was thick with people, and I searched for a way to get to the train platform. I spotted a lift and squeezed into a queue of about a dozen people, who were dutifully waiting even though there were two escalators less than 100m away. There was an air of anticipation as the lift cranked its way up to the concourse. As the lift arrived, everyone surged forward. Once the last possible person had squeezed in, the lift doors slid shut with a ‘ding’. I was left on the concourse, perplexed.\r\nThis ostensible lack of consideration hadn’t been my experience of Singapore thus far. Previously, construction workers had stopped their jackhammers as I walked past so as not to wake my sleeping baby. I’d had umbrellas offered to me when getting off the bus in the teeming rain. So why did getting into a lift seem like survival of the fittest?\r\nI soon learned that this is what it is to be ‘kiasu’.\r\nKiasu is a Hokkien (Chinese dialect) word that comes from ‘kia’, which means afraid, and ‘su’, which means to lose: fear of losing out. In 2007, the word was included in the Oxford English Dictionary, where it’s described as ‘…a grasping, selfish attitude’.\r\nDr Leong Chan-Hoong, senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies at the National University of Singapore, explains it as survival instinct. The small, young nation, just 53 years old, he told me, is vulnerably situated in the middle of South East Asia, surrounded by neighbours who are culturally different from Singapore.\r\n“It’s always been drilled into the minds of Singaporeans that you’ve got to be self-reliant, you’ve got to stay hungry, you’ve got to be ahead of the curve… the need to stay ahead has always been part of the social psyche,” he said.\r\n The need to stay ahead has always been part of the social psyche \r\nIn practical terms, this means Singaporeans hate missing out and love a bargain. They will queue endlessly for the latest model of a phone or even a limited edition Hello Kitty toy in a McDonald’s Happy Meal. Singaporeans themselves joke about their ‘elbows out’ mentality at buffet meals, piling their plates as high as possible. And going to a food court means quickly coming to terms with the Singlish word ‘chope’, which means reserving a space while getting food by putting something such a packet of tissues or umbrella on the table.\r\n“Kiasuism is still rather controversial as a behaviour,” said local literary critic Gwee Li Sui. “Nobody likes it done to them, and yet many quite happily practise it. When we see others show it, our feelings range from awe and mild amusement to annoyance and embarrassment.”\r\nThis shows that the country’s residents are keenly self-aware about the difficulty in finding a balance between getting ahead in life without eroding their society’s largely positive value system.\r\n Nobody likes it done to them, and yet many quite happily practise it \r\nBut not everyone in Singapore sees kiasuism through such a serious lens. Artist Johnny Lau found a way to get Singaporeans to examine themselves through comedy. He created the hugely popular comic character Mr Kiasu, who became an iconic part of the cultural landscape in Singapore during the early ‘90s and is now enjoying a resurgence with a new instalment of the comic called Mr Kiasu: Everything Also Like Real.\r\nIn the late 1980s, Lau returned to Singapore from the US, where he had been studying. With The Simpsons making a big splash on TV, Lau wanted to create something similar in Singapore. The idea came to him while he was doing his mandatory National Service with the army.\r\nTo his surprise, despite there being a mix of ethnicities and languages in Singapore’s multicultural army camps, the young officers managed to find common ground through military slang.\r\n“I met a lot of people who were using certain words that cut across different races. Not because you are Chinese, Indian or Malay,” he said. “The word ‘kiasu’ was popping up inside the army camps. It wasn’t commonly used outside the camp.”\r\nIn this context, according to A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English, the word ‘kia su’ (as it was written in its original form), was used to mean over-cautious soldiers who were afraid to fail. For example, in Michael Chiang’s play, Army Daze, first staged in 1987, a kia su soldier is so afraid of failing his eye test that he memorises the whole eye chart the night before.\r\nBut for Lau, it also described “the trait of Singaporeans always wanting to be number one, always want to be ahead, keeping up with the Joneses,” as he put it. And in the two years it took him to develop the character of Mr Kiasu, the word found its way into the mainstream.\r\nWhen the first edition of Mr Kiasu appeared in 1990, the reaction from the public was mixed.\r\n“Sixty percent were offended, 40% were laughing” Lau said. “The ones who were offended were more conservative people who thought you should not make us look bad in front of fellow citizens or people outside Singapore – as they will laugh at us. But I said that’s the whole point of comics!”\r\nAnd so Lau persevered. Mr Kiasu was so popular that a TV series and toy range followed, and a McDonald’s burger was even named after it. Within two months of its launch, 1.2 million Kiasu Burgers (a chicken burger with extra lettuce, extra mayonnaise and an extra-long bun) had been sold.\r\n“I think when it was first coined in the ‘90s, it had largely negative connotations, it was somewhat loaded,” Chan-Hoong said. “But over the years it has become a lot more nuanced… it’s [become] almost like a competency.”\r\n“It’s good to be somewhat kiasu… it’s very contextual,” he added. \r\nIn recent years, kiasuism has come under fire from politicians and others. Kuik Shiao-Yin, a nominated Member of Parliament criticised it for stifling creativity in business, saying that the kiasu entrepreneur is driven by anxiety to make short wins rather than winning at the long game.\r\nBut other Singaporeans are determined to keep the kiasu spirit alive.\r\nI asked Cecilia Leong, a mother of four-year-old twins, whether the so-called ‘kiasu parent’ is still relevant. Her response: “Of course it’s still relevant, I am one!”\r\n Only by being number one can we survive \r\nBefore becoming a mother, she was determined not to put pressure on her children to achieve academically, but afterwards was a different story.\r\n“I started to look for a good preschool when they were six months old,” she said, adding that she also found herself signing her twins up for extra English reading classes and hiring a private Chinese tutor.\r\n“I realised that I have to give them the best that I can. Being in a competitive country, I do not wish to let my children lag behind other children,” she said, admitting that would cause her more stress.\r\nHer husband Lim Soon Jinn chimed in with his take on kiasu. He believes that because his country has no natural resources, being kiasu is key to its success. “Our forefathers survived through being competitive, and therefore as a parent we need to instil this spirit in our children from an early age.”\r\n“We have no choice,” he said. “We can never break out of this because being competitive is our only resource. No water, no food, no land – only by being number one can we survive.\r\nSo it seems that kiasu isn’t simply the #FOMO of an Instagram generation. It’s a deep-rooted sense that only by being ambitious and wanting to be the best will you (and your country) be able to thrive.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�5鏃� 浣滆��:鑾庢媺路鍩哄环锛圫arah Keating锛�\r\n鎴戝湪鏂板姞鍧′粎浠呭緟浜嗗嚑涓湀鏃堕棿灏辩粡鍘嗕簡绗竴娆♀�滄�曡緭涓讳箟鈥濓紙Kiasuism锛夈�傞偅鏄竴涓槦鏈熷叚鐨勪笅鍗堬紝澶╂皵鐐庣儹锛屾垜鍦ㄨ喘鐗╀腑蹇冮�涗簡鍑犱釜灏忔椂鍚庯紝鎺ㄧ潃濠村効杞﹀甫鐫�涓や釜鐤叉儷鐨勫瀛愬墠寰�鍦伴搧绔欏洖瀹躲��\r\n杞︾珯浜烘弧涓烘偅锛屾垜鎯充笂鐢垫鍒扮珯鍙帮紝鐢垫闂ㄥ墠宸茬粡鏈夊崄鍑犱釜浜哄湪鎺掗槦銆傚綋鐢垫鍒拌揪鏃讹紝浜轰滑绐佺劧閮藉鍕囦笂鍓嶆尋杩涚數姊紝褰撲粬浠渶鍚庝竴涓汉鎸よ繘鍘诲悗锛岄棬\"鍙�\"鐨勪竴澹板叧涓婁簡锛屽彧鐣欎笅鎴戝拰瀛╁瓙绔欏湪閭ｉ噷涓嶇煡鎵�鎺��\r\n鍦ㄦ涔嬪墠锛屾垜鍦ㄦ柊鍔犲潯杩樻病鏈夐亣鍒拌繃杩欑瀹屽叏涓嶉【浠栦汉鐨勭幇璞°�傚綋鎴戞帹鐫�濠村効杞﹁矾杩囧缓绛戝伐鍦伴檮杩戞椂锛屽缓绛戝伐浜轰細鍋滄鏁叉墦宸ヤ綔鎷呭績浼氬惖閱掔啛鐫＄殑濠村効锛涗笅闆ㄦ椂锛屽湪杞︾珯绛夎溅浼氭湁浜哄府鎴戞墦浼炪�備负浠�涔堝湪杞︾珯涓婄數姊椂锛屼細鍑虹幇杩欑浜夊厛鎭愬悗锛�\"閫傝�呯敓瀛�\"鐨勭幇璞″憿锛�\r\n鎴戝悗鏉ョ煡閬撲簡锛岄偅灏辨槸鎵�璋撶殑鎬曡緭蹇冪悊銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n                    鑾庢媺路鍩哄环鍦ㄦ柊鍔犲潯鎵嶄綇浜嗗嚑涓湀灏辩粡鍘嗕簡鎬曡緭鏂囧寲Author Sarah Keating had only been in Singapore a few months when she first experienced kiasuism\r\n                \r\nKiasu鏄椊鍗楄瘽閲岀殑涓�涓瘝锛孠ia鐨勬剰鎬濇槸\"鎷呭績銆佸鎬�\"锛宻u鏄緭鎺夛紝鎵�浠iasu灏辨槸鈥滄儕杈撯�濓紝鎰忔�濆氨鏄�滄�曡緭鈥濄��2007骞达紝杩欎釜璇嶈鏀惰繘鐗涙触鑻辫璇嶅吀锛圤xford English Dictionary锛夛紝灏嗗叾瑙ｉ噴涓�\"涓�绉嶈椽濠�岃嚜绉佺殑鎬佸害\"銆�\r\n鏂板姞鍧″浗绔嬪ぇ瀛︼紙National University of Singapore锛夋斂绛栧涔犵爺绌舵墍锛圛nstitute of Policy Studies锛夎祫娣辩爺绌跺憳姊佹尟闆勫崥澹皢Kiasu瑙ｉ噴涓烘槸涓�绉嶅垢瀛樻湰鑳姐�備粬璇达紝杩欎釜鍙湁53骞村巻鍙茬殑寰皬鍥藉鍦ㄤ笢鍗椾簹鍦板尯鍦颁綅鍗佸垎鑴嗗急锛岃涓�浜涙枃鍖栦紶缁熼潪甯镐笉鍚岀殑閭诲浗鎵�鍖呭洿銆�\r\n\"鏂板姞鍧′汉姘歌繙閮界墷璁颁竴瀹氳鑷姏鏇寸敓锛岄潬鑷繁锛岃鏈洦缁哥吉锛岄偅绉嶄竴瀹氳浜夊厛鐨勫績鐞嗗凡缁忔垚涓烘柊鍔犲潯绀句細绮剧鐨勪竴閮ㄥ垎銆�\"浠栬銆�\r\n涔熷氨鏄锛屾柊鍔犲潯浜轰笉鎰块敊杩囨満浼氾紝琚惤涓嬨�備粬浠細鑰愬績鍦版帓闀块槦鍙负浜嗚喘涔版渶鏂版鐨勬墜鏈猴紝鐢氳嚦涓嶄細閿欒繃楹﹀綋鍔冲紑蹇冨椁愭彁渚涚殑闄愰噺鐗圚ello Kitty鐜╁叿銆傛柊鍔犲潯浜鸿嚜宸变篃寮�鐜╃瑧鍦拌锛屽湪鑷姪椁愪笂浠栦滑浼氭妸鍒汉鎸ゅ紑锛岀洏瀛愰噷鐨勯鐗╂�昏鍫嗗緱婊℃弧鐨勩�傚湪缇庨琛楀悆楗紝浠栦滑浼氫竴杈逛拱楗紝涓�杈瑰崰浣嶁�斺�旂敤涓�鍖呴宸剧焊鎴栦竴鎶婇洦浼炲崰鎹妗岋紝浜庢槸鏈変簡涓�涓柊鍔犲潯鑻辫chope鍗犱綅銆�\r\n鏂板姞鍧′竴浣嶆枃瀛﹁瘎璁哄榄忎繍鐟炶锛�\"杩欑鎵�璋撴�曡緭琛屼负杩樻槸寰堟湁浜夎鐨勩�傝櫧鐒舵病浜哄枩娆㈤亣鍒拌繖绉嶈涓猴紝浣嗕粬浠嚜宸卞嵈姣笉鐘硅鲍鍦拌繖鏍峰仛銆傚綋鎴戜滑鐪嬪埌杩欑琛屼负锛屽績閲屼細鎰熷埌鏈夌偣鐣忔儳銆佷笉楂樺叴锛岃繕鏈夊按灏��\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Kiasu鏄椊鍗楄瘽閲岀殑涓�涓瘝锛屾剰鎬濇槸\"鎬曡緭\"Kiasu is a Hokkien word meaning 鈥榝ear of losing out鈥� \r\n                \r\n2015骞存柊鍔犲潯鍋氱殑涓�椤规湁鍏冲浗姘戜环鍊艰鐨勮皟鏌ユ樉绀猴紝鈥滄�曡緭鈥濅綅浜庝粬浠鏂板姞鍧＄ぞ浼氱湅娉曞墠10鍚嶏紝鍚嶅垪鍓嶈寘鐨勮繕鏈夌珵浜夋�у拰鑷垜涓轰腑蹇冦�傝�岃闂強浠栦滑鑷繁鐨勪环鍊艰鍜岃涓烘椂锛屽墠10鍚嶄腑鍖呮嫭瀹跺涵浜叉儏銆佸弸璋娿�佸叧鐖卞拰璇氬疄銆�\r\n浣嗗湪鏂板姞鍧″苟涓嶆槸鎵�鏈変汉閮芥妸鈥滄�曡緭鈥濈湅寰楅偅涔堜弗鑲冦�傝壓鏈绾︾堪灏悸峰垬锛圝ohnny Lau锛夐�氳繃鍠滃墽褰㈠紡璁╂柊鍔犲潯浜鸿璇嗗埌杩欎釜闂銆備粬鍒涗綔浜嗕竴涓緢鍙楁杩庣殑瑙掕壊\"鎬曡緭鍏堢敓\"锛圡r Kiasu锛夛紝20涓栫邯90骞翠唬鍒濊繖涓鑹查潪甯歌蛋绾紝鐜板湪鍥�\"鎬曡緭鍏堢敓\"鐨勬柊鍓х洰鑰屽啀搴︽祦琛岃捣鏉ャ��\r\n80骞翠唬鏈紝鍒樺厛鐢熷湪缇庡浗鐣欏涔嬪悗杩斿洖鏂板姞鍧°�傚綋鏃剁編鍥界數瑙嗗姩鐢诲墽銆婅緵鏅．涓�瀹躲�嬶紙The Simpsons锛夋绾㈡瀬涓�鏃讹紝浜庢槸浠栨兂鍦ㄦ柊鍔犲潯鍒涗綔涓�涓悓鏍峰彈娆㈣繋鐨勭數瑙嗗墽鐩�備骇鐢熻繖涓兂娉曟椂浠栨鍦ㄦ湇鍏靛焦銆�\r\n鍦ㄥ啗钀ラ噷浠栨儕璁跺湴鍙戠幇锛屼笉绠￠偅浜涘啗浜轰滑鏄粈涔堟枃鍖栬儗鏅紝浠栦滑閮借兘閫氳繃涓�浜涘啗闃熶繗璇壘鍒板叡鍚岃瑷�銆�\"鎴戝彂鐜扳�滄�曡緭鈥濊繖涓瘝缁忓父鍦ㄥ啗钀ラ噷鍑虹幇锛� 涓嶇鏄崕浜恒�佸嵃搴︿汉鎴栭┈鏉ヤ汉锛屼粬浠兘璇达紝鑰屽湪鍐涜惀澶栧苟涓嶅父鐢ㄣ��\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    鍦ㄦ柊鍔犲潯锛宑hope鐨勬剰鎬濇槸鍦ㄥ闈㈠悆楗椂鐢ㄤ竴鍖呴宸剧焊鎴栭洦浼炴潵鍗犳瀛�To 鈥榗hope鈥� means to reserve a table by leaving something such a packet of tissues or an umbrella \r\n                \r\n鍒樺厛鐢熻繖鏍峰舰瀹硅锛�\"鏂板姞鍧′汉鐨勪竴涓壒鐐规槸鎬绘兂浜夌涓�锛岀粷瀵逛笉鑳借鍒汉钀戒笅銆�\"浠栫敤浜嗕袱骞存椂闂村垱浣滃嚭浜�\"鎬曡緭鍏堢敓\"杩欎釜瑙掕壊锛岃�� Kiasu 杩欎釜璇嶄篃闅忎箣鍦ㄤ富娴佺ぞ浼氭祦琛岃捣鏉ャ��\r\n1990骞�\"鎬曡緭鍏堢敓\"鐢佃鍓ч娆′笌瑙備紬瑙侀潰鏃讹紝鍏紬鍙嶅簲鍙傚樊銆�\r\n鍒樺厛鐢熻锛�\"澶х害60锛呯殑浜烘劅瑙夊彈鍒板啋鐘紝40锛呯殑浜烘劅瑙夊ソ绗戙�傞偅浜涙劅瑙夊彈鍒板啋鐘殑浜哄ぇ澶氭瘮杈冧繚瀹堬紝浠栦滑瑙夊緱涓嶅簲璇ュ湪澶栦汉闈㈠墠鎻煭锛岃鏂板姞鍧′汉闅惧牚銆備粬浠涓哄浜轰細绗戣瘽鏂板姞鍧′汉鐨勩�傚彲鏄垜璇达紝鎴戣鐨勫氨鏄繖鏍风殑鍠滃墽鏁堟灉鍛�锛�\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    鏂板姞鍧′汉浼氳�愬績鎺掗暱闃燂紝涔版渶鏂版鐨勬墜鏈�Singaporeans will queue endlessly for the latest model of a phone\r\n                \r\n浜嬪疄璇佹槑鍒樺厛鐢熺瑧鍒颁簡鏈�鍚庛��\"鎬曡緭鍏堢敓\"鐢佃绯诲垪鏋佷负鎴愬姛锛岀敱姝ゅ張鍙戣浜嗙浉鍏崇帺鍏枫�備竴娆鹃害褰撳姵姹夊牎鐢氳嚦鐢ㄦ鏉ュ懡鍚嶏紝浠栦滑鍦ㄤ袱涓湀涔嬪唴鍞嚭浜�120涓囦釜\"鎬曡緭姹夊牎\"锛圞iasu Burgers锛夈��\r\n涓嶈繃锛岃繎骞存潵鎬曡緭鏂囧寲鍙楀埌涓�浜涙斂娌诲鍜屽叾浠栦汉澹殑鎵硅瘎銆傛柊鍔犲潯璁細璁憳閮檽闊佃涓猴紝杩欑鎬佸害鍍靛寲浜嗗晢涓氫腑鐨勫垱鎰忔�э紝浠栬閭ｄ簺鎬曡緭鐨勪紒涓氬浠洰鍏夌煭娴咃紝鍙【鍙婄溂鍓嶅埄鐩婏紝鑰屾病鏈夐暱杩滅溂鍏夈��\r\n\r\n\r\n                    鏂板姞鍧′汉涓嶆効鎰忚钀戒笅锛屼篃鍠滄鎹′究瀹�Singaporeans hate missing out and love a bargain\r\n                \r\n浣嗘湁涓嶅皯鏂板姞鍧′汉鍐虫剰灏�\"鎬曡緭\"绮剧淇濇寔涓嬪幓銆�\r\n鎴戦棶涓�浣嶆湁涓�瀵�4宀佸ぇ鍙岃優鑳庣殑骞磋交姣嶄翰姊佸コ澹紝鏄惁鎵�璋撶殑\"鎬曡緭瀹堕暱\"鐜板湪浠嶇劧瀛樺湪锛屽ス璇达紝\"褰撶劧锛屾垜灏辨槸涓�涓紒\"\r\n鍋氭瘝浜蹭箣鍓嶅ス鏇炬兂锛屽皢鏉ヤ竴瀹氫笉缁欒嚜宸辩殑瀛╁瓙鍦ㄥ涔犱笂鏂藉姞鍘嬪姏銆備絾鏈変簡瀛╁瓙涔嬪悗锛屾儏鍐靛氨鍙樹簡銆�\r\n\"瀛╁瓙鎵�6涓湀鐨勬椂鍊欐垜灏卞紑濮嬪鎵惧ソ骞煎効鍥紝\"濂硅锛屽ス杩樼粰涓や釜瀛╁瓙鎶ヤ簡鑻辫鐝紝骞堕泧浜嗕竴浣嶄腑鏂囩鏁欍��\r\n\"鎴戞剰璇嗗埌鎴戝繀椤诲敖涓�鍒囧姫鍔涚粰瀛╁瓙鏈�濂界殑鏁欒偛鍜岀敓娲汇�傚湪涓�涓珵浜夊姝ゆ縺鐑堢殑鍥藉锛屾垜鍙笉鎰胯鎴戠殑瀛╁瓙钀藉湪鍒殑瀛╁瓙鍚庨潰銆�\"濂硅繖鏍疯锛屽苟鎵胯瀛╁瓙钀藉湪鍒汉鍚庨潰浼氳濂规洿鏈夊帇鍔涖��\r\n\r\n\r\n                    鏋楀厛鐢熻锛�\"鎴戜滑涓嶈兘鏀惧純锛屽洜涓轰繚鎸佺珵浜夊姏鏄垜浠敮涓�鐨勮祫婧�\"Lim Soon Jinn: 鈥淲e can never break out of this because being competitive is our only resource鈥�\r\n                \r\n绮卞コ澹殑涓堝か鏋楀厛鐢熶篃鍔犲叆璁ㄨ銆備粬璁や负锛屾柊鍔犲潯鍥犱负缂轰箯鑷劧璧勬簮锛屽彇寰楁垚鍔熺殑鍞竴閫斿緞灏辨槸淇濇寔鈥滄�曡緭鈥濈簿绁炪��\"鎴戜滑鐨勭鍏堥�氳繃鑷繁鐨勭珵浜夊姏鑰屽垢瀛樹笅鏉ワ紝鎵�浠ユ垜浠仛浜嗙埗姣嶄箣鍚庯紝灏辫鎶婅繖绉嶇簿绁炰紶缁欎笅涓�浠ｏ紝浠庡皬灏辫寮�濮嬨��\"\r\n浠栬锛�\"鎴戜滑娌℃湁閫夋嫨锛屾垜浠笉鑳芥斁寮冿紝鍥犱负淇濇寔绔炰簤鍔涙槸鎴戜滑鍞竴鐨勮祫婧愩�傛病鏈夋按婧愶紝娌℃湁椋熺墿锛屾病鏈夊湡鍦� 鈥斺�� 鍙湁浜夊綋绗竴鎴戜滑鎵嶈兘骞稿瓨涓嬪幓銆�\"\r\n鎵�浠ワ紝鈥滄�曡緭鈥濈湅鏉ュ苟涓嶆槸Instagram涓�浠ｄ汉鐨勪笉鎰块敊杩囦换浣曟満浼氱殑\"绀句氦鎺�\"锛岃�屾槸娣辨繁妞嶆牴浜庢柊鍔犲潯浜哄績涓殑涓�涓俊蹇� 鈥斺�斿彧鏈夋垚涓烘渶妫掔殑锛屼綘鍜屼綘鐨勫浗瀹舵墠鑳藉垢瀛樹笌绻佽崳銆�"
