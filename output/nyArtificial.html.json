"Every technology goes through an age of discovery and an age of implementation. During the age of discovery, the critical work takes place in research laboratories, where scientists make the breakthroughs that move the field forward. During the age of implementation, the technology reaches a point of practical utility and begins spilling out of the lab and into the world.\r\n\n每项技术都会经历一个发现期和一个实施期。在发现期，关键工作在研究实验室里，科学家在那里取得突破，推动该领域向前发展。在实施期，这项技术达到了有实际用途的程度，开始从实验室涌向世界。\r\n\nOver the past decade, I’ve watched firsthand as the field of artificial intelligence has transitioned from one phase to the other. The 1980s and 1990s were a period of discovery in A.I., one that I participated in through my research on speech recognition at Carnegie Mellon University and Apple. More recently, I participated in the implementation phase through my work as the head of Google China and as an early investor in the Chinese mobile internet.\r\n\n在过去的十年里，我亲眼目睹了人工智能领域从一个阶段向另一个阶段的过渡。20世纪80、90年代是人工智能的发现期，我通过在卡内基梅隆大学(Carnegie Mellon University)和苹果公司(Apple)从事语音识别研究，参与了这个时期。再后来，我作为谷歌中国负责人以及中国移动互联网的早期投资者，参与了这项技术的实施阶段。\r\n\nThis movement from discovery to implementation marks a significant shift in A.I.’s center of gravity — away from the United States and toward China. The age of discovery relied heavily on innovation coming out of the United States, which excels at visionary research and moonshot projects. The country’s freewheeling intellectual environment, unparalleled network of research universities and traditional openness to immigrants (such as myself) have for decades made it an incubator for big ideas in A.I.\r\n\n从发现到实施的转变，标志着人工智能研发重心从美国转向中国的重大转型。发现期大量依赖从美国出来的创新，美国擅长有远见的研究和探索性的项目。美国无拘无束的学术环境、无与伦比的研究型大学系统，以及传统上对移民（我就是其中之一）的开放态度，使其在几十年里一直是人工智能领域重大构想的孵化器。\r\n\nA.I. implementation, however, plays to a different set of strengths, many of which are manifested in China: abundant data, a hypercompetitive business landscape and a government that actively adapts public infrastructure with A.I. in mind. China also excels at turning an abstract scientific breakthrough into thousands of useful and commercially viable products. This process, which is far more challenging than most researchers acknowledge, has driven the market capitalization of many Chinese tech companies far beyond that of the American peers they were once accused of “copying.”\r\n\n然而，人工智能的实施取决于另一组优势，其中许多正在中国显现出来：丰富的数据、竞争极度激烈的商业环境，以及一个以人工智能理念来积极改造公共基础设施的政府。中国还擅长将一个抽象的科研突破转化为成千上万有用的、商业上可行的产品。这个过程的困难程度，是大多数科研人员没有认识到的，这个过程也让许多中国技术公司得到比它们曾被指“抄袭”的美国同行高得多的估值。\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nEvery technology goes through an age of discovery and an age of implementation.

China also excels at turning an abstract scientific breakthrough into thousands of useful and commercially viable products. This process, which is far more challenging than most researchers acknowledge, has driven the market capitalization of many Chinese tech companies far beyond that of the American peers they were once accused of “copying.”\r\n\n然而，人工智能的实施取决于另一组优势，其中许多正在中国显现出来：丰富的数据、竞争极度激烈的商业环境，以及一个以人工智能理念来积极改造公共基础设施的政府。中国还擅长将一个抽象的科研突破转化为成千上万有用的、商业上可行的产品。这个过程的困难程度，是大多数科研人员没有认识到的，这个过程也让许多中国技术公司得到比它们曾被指“抄袭”的美国同行高得多的估值。\r\n\n\r\nVisionary research will always be important to A.I., which means that China still has much to learn from the United States. But as practical implementation increasingly becomes the name of the game, the United States now has much to learn from China, too.\r\n\n有远见的研究对人工智能始终是重要的，这意味着中国仍有很多东西要向美国学习。但是，随着实施日益成为最为重要的方向，美国现在也有很多东西要向中国学习。\r\n\nAnalysts in the West often acknowledge the areas in which China has an advantage in A.I., but they tend to misunderstand the nature of China’s strength in each one. With regard to China’s abundant data, analysts often point to the sheer size of China’s population (which owns 1.1 billion mobile internet devices) and claim that lax privacy laws allow a free-for-all with user data. But China’s core data advantage lies not just in breadth (the number of users) and access (the amount of data that users contribute) but also in the depth of data on each user — the real-world activities of Chinese people that are captured in a digital format useful to an A.I. algorithm.\r\n\n西方的分析人士经常承认中国在人工智能方面有优势的领域，但他们对中国在每个优势领域的实力本质往往有误解。就中国丰富的数据而言，分析人士经常指出中国人口的庞大规模（中国人拥有11亿部移动互联网设备），并声称不严格的隐私法律让用户数据的使用不加管制。但中国的核心数据优势不仅在于广度（用户数量）和获取（用户贡献的数据量），还在于每个用户的数据的深度，即使用对人工智能算法有意义的数字形式捕获中国人的真实世界活动。\r\n\nFor instance, Chinese consumers regularly use apps like WeChat to do an astonishing range of real-world things: buy groceries, book doctor’s appointments, manage their electricity and water utilities, take out microloans. Chinese people make up 68 percent of global demand for bike-sharing and ride-hailing apps. This widespread use of apps in part reflects a “leapfrog effect”: Chinese people never truly adopted credit cards, so they jumped directly to mobile payments; Chinese hospitals never had extensive traditional systems for booking patients, so they are jumping straight to smartphone apps; and so on.\r\n\n例如，中国消费者经常使用微信这样的应用程序来做现实生活中的事情，范围之广令人难以置信：买日用品、预约医生、交水电费、申请小额贷款等等。中国人对自行车共享和网约车应用软件的需求占全球需求的68%。应用程序的这种广泛使用在一定程度上反映了一种“跨越效应”：中国人从未真正养成使用信用卡的习惯，于是他们直接跨越到移动支付；中国的医院从来没有广泛使用传统的病人预约系统，于是它们直接跨越到智能手机应用程序；诸如此类。\r\n\nWhat emerges from these enormous data flows is a multidimensional picture of each Chinese user, which allows A.I. companies to better tailor their services. Silicon Valley companies are working on similar products, but the data at their disposal is largely limited to online activities: Google searches, YouTube views, Amazon purchases and Facebook likes.\r\n\n从这些巨大的数据流中显现出来的是每个中国用户的一个多维图像，这让人工智能公司能够更好地为他们定制服务。硅谷的公司也在开发类似的产品，但他们掌握的数据大多局限于在线活动：谷歌上的搜索、YouTube上视频点击数量、亚马逊上的购物和Facebook上的点赞。\r\n\nWith regard to its competitive business ecosystem for A.I., China’s advantage is frequently mischaracterized by Western analysts who view Chinese technology as built largely on intellectual property theft. This misunderstanding reflects a difference in cultural attitudes over a perfectly legal form of copying: imitating a successful business model and then tweaking it.\r\n\n就人工智能的竞争性商业生态系统而言，中国的优势经常被西方分析人士错误地进行描述，他们认为中国的科技主要建立在知识产权窃取上。这种误解反映了对一种完全合法的复制形式——模仿成功的商业模式，然后加以调整——的文化态度差异。\r\n\nIn Silicon Valley, there is substantial stigma attached to imitating the business models or features of other companies. Doing so violates the “think different” ethos associated with innovators like Steve Jobs. The result is that pioneers often go unchallenged for long periods, allowed to dominate the industry even though they don’t explore or exploit all of their technology’s possibilities.\r\n\n在硅谷，模仿其他公司的商业模式或其他企业的特征是相当可耻的事。这样做有悖于史蒂夫·乔布斯(Steve Jobs)等创新者提倡的“卓逸不群”的信念。其结果是，先驱者往往在很长一段时间内不受挑战，即使他们不充分探索或利用他们的技术的所有可能性，人们也允许他们统治他们所在的行业。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nIn contrast, Chinese entrepreneurs have few qualms about imitating what works. Once a concept is proved to have traction, dozens or even hundreds of other companies rush into the industry, setting off a ferocious fight for survival. The result is analogous to natural selection in evolution: All the companies start from the same branch on the family tree, but they make mutations in their product or business model to gain an edge. The companies with tweaked products that work well survive and grow, while businesses that are slow to adapt perish.\r\n\n相比之下，中国创业者对于模仿成功的企业没有什么顾虑。一旦一个概念被证明具有吸引力，数十家甚至数百家其他公司就会涌入这个行业，展开一场激烈的生存战。其结果类似于演化中的自然选择：所有的公司都在同一个基础上开始，但它们通过改变产品或商业模式来获得优势。那些拿出了运转良好的改进产品的公司得以生存和发展，而那些适应得慢的企业则会灭亡。\r\n\nYou can see this clearly in how the sharing economy developed in China. After companies like Uber and DiDi proved the viability of ride sharing, China’s start-up world tried out every possible iteration of it: shared basketballs, shared umbrellas, shared bicycles, shared mobile phone chargers. Most of these efforts died quickly, but those that survived — including a handful of the strongest shared-bike start-ups — turned into multibillion-dollar companies and revolutionized urban transport in just a couple of years.\r\n\n从分享经济在中国的发展就可以清楚地看到这一点。在优步(Uber)和滴滴等公司证明了网约车可行性之后，中国的初创企业尝试了所有可能的分享方式：分享篮球、分享雨伞、分享自行车、分享手机充电器。这些努力大多很快就夭折了，但那些幸存下来的公司——包括少数几家实力最强的共享单车初创企业——成了估值数十亿美元的公司，并在短短几年内彻底改变了城市交通。\r\n\nFinally, there is the question of the Chinese government’s support of A.I. In the simplistic story often told in the United States, Chinese bureaucrats in the central government pick winners among the companies, load them up with enormous subsidies and then protect them from foreign competition. But this account fundamentally misunderstands how the Chinese government is encouraging A.I. implementation.\r\n\n最后，还有一个中国政府支持人工智能的问题。美国人经常讲这么一个简单粗暴的故事，说身在中央政府的中国官员们从这些公司中挑选出赢家，向它们提供巨额补贴，然后保护它们免受外国竞争。但这个故事从根本上误解了中国政府是如何鼓励人工智能的实施的。\r\n\nThe Chinese government understands that as A.I. moves from affecting the purely digital world to the physical one, public infrastructure and institutions will have to change. If we want autonomous cars to reduce accidents, we may need to embed sensors in our roads. If we want A.I.-powered diagnosis to spot cancer earlier, we may need hospital administrators to develop data-sharing agreements that protect privacy while also allowing research to be conducted. These are decisions that entail a degree of risk for public actors, particularly in a highly combative political environment where every misstep becomes fodder for the opposition.\r\n\n中国政府明白，随着人工智能从纯数字世界转向实体世界，公共基础设施和制度将不得不随之改变。如果我们要让自动驾驶汽车减少事故，我们也许需要在道路上嵌入传感器。如果我们想用人工智能辅助的诊断来尽早发现癌症，我们可能需要医院管理者们制定出既保护隐私、同时让研究得以进行的数据共享协议。这些都是给公职人物带来一定程度风险的决定，尤其是在一个斗争残酷的政治环境中，每一个失误都会成为反对派攻击的口实。\r\n\nIn declaring A.I. to be a top national priority, Beijing has sent a signal to local officials that they will be rewarded for fostering this kind of A.I. infrastructure. The Chinese model isn’t based on top-down orders or limitless subsidies; it’s based on encouraging local officials to make the changes needed in their area so that private A.I. companies can develop products that can actually be used.\r\n\n北京把人工智能宣布为国家首要任务，是向地方官员们发出一个信号，那就是，他们将会因促进人工智能基础设施的发展而得到奖励。中国的模式不是靠自上而下的命令、或无限的补贴；中国的模式靠的是鼓励地方官员，在他们所在的地方做必要的改变，以便私营的人工智能公司能够开发出可以实际使用的产品。\r\n\nAm I arguing that China now has the recipe for A.I. success? Not at all. The fact that the field is shifting from discovery to implementation does not mean that discovery no longer matters. Indeed, with many problems in A.I., it is unclear which approach is best.\r\n\n我这是在说中国现在拥有人工智能的成功秘诀吗？根本不是。这个领域正在从发现转向实施的事实，并不意味着发现不再重要。事实上人工智能存在众多问题，以至于还不知道怎样做是最佳的方式。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nConsider an A.I.-powered product like fully autonomous vehicles. Technology companies in both countries are still feverishly chasing the dream of the large-scale deployment of cars that drive themselves far better than any human could. Who wins this race is likely to depend on whether the main obstacle turns out to be a matter of core technology or simply execution details. If it’s technical — major improvements in core algorithms — then the advantage goes to the United States. If it’s implementation — smart infrastructure or policy adaptation — then the advantage goes to China.\r\n\n比如像全自动汽车这样的人工智能驱动产品。中美两国的科技公司都仍在拼命地追逐着一个梦想，要把一种自我驾驶能力远远超过人类的汽车大规模投入使用。谁将在这场竞争中胜出，很可能取决于最终的主要障碍是核心技术问题，还是仅仅是执行细节问题。如果主要障碍是技术的话，比如核心算法仍需重大改进，那么优势就在美国。如果是实施的话，比如需要有智能基础设施或进行政策调整，那么优势则在中国。\r\n\nAt this point, we don’t know which it will be, but we do know that each country can improve its odds of success by learning from the other’s strengths. Chinese researchers, start-ups and A.I. companies should let their imaginations run a little wilder, placing long-term bets that give them a chance of breaking new ground rather than playing catch-up. At the same time, American companies should embrace the less glamorous business of relentlessly developing variations on a proven concept. And American policymakers could move away from a hands-off stance toward A.I., looking instead to actively adapt the nation’s physical structures and public institutions to better mesh with new technology.\r\n\n此时此刻，我们还不知道是哪个，但我们知道一国可以通过学习另一国的长处来提高自己成功的概率。中国的研究人员、初创企业和人工智能公司应该让自己的想象力更放开一点，敢于把赌注押在更长远的东西上，让自己有打开新局面的机会，而不是老在追赶。与此同时，美国公司应该乐于去做没那么光鲜的事——不断就一个经验证的概念去发展变种。美国的政策制定者们也可以改变对人工智能放手不管的立场，而是积极地考虑如何调整国家的实体设施和公共机构，以便更好地与新技术相结合。\r\n\nIf both countries can make these shifts in perspective, then what might look like a zero-sum battle for A.I. supremacy between China and the United States will begin to resemble something totally different: an opportunity to learn across cultures and collectively advance the global project of building A.I. that improves human lives.\r\n\n如果中美两国能够从这个角度来做出调整的话，那么一场看起来是中美两国之间争夺人工智能制高点的零和对抗，将会显露截然不同的样子：一个跨文化学习、齐心协力将一个全球项目——发展能改善人类生活的人工智能——向前推进的机会。\r\n\n李开复 (@kaifulee)是创新工厂的董事长兼首席执行官。他即将出版新书《人工智能超级大国：中国、硅谷和世界政治经济新秩序》(A.I.
