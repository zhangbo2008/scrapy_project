"You have the basics down: doing laundry, keeping the bathroom clean, wiping the kitchen countertops 鈥� but dirt and grime have a bad habit of collecting in the strangest places, including the ones you don鈥檛 think to look. Here are some spots around your house you should consider cleaning more often, if you clean them at all, because they鈥檙e probably pretty filthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight out of the gate, we should point out that you should clean these spaces not because they鈥檒l make you sick or anything, but because they鈥檙e probably pretty gross and collect dirt and dust easily. They may accumulate bacteria as well, but there鈥檚 no reason to be a germaphobe about them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople with immune disorders or who are prone to sickness may want to pay closer attention than others, but in many cases, your cleaning efforts are just a good way to keep them in good working order for a nice long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoorknobs and handles\r\n\r\n\r\nYou probably don鈥檛 think to clean off the doorknobs and handles around your home very often, but they鈥檙e worth a quick wipe the next time you鈥檙e cleaning in the same room. When you think about how often we touch the door knobs and handles in our homes, especially with dirty hands or on the way in or out of the bathroom, you may even choose to make a habit of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether it鈥檚 the handle to a kitchen cabinet, the doorknob to the bathroom or just the front door to your home, give it a wipe down from time to time, if for no other reason than to keep them free of debris and pleasant to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou鈥檝e probably heard that door handles 鈥� especially bathroom door handles 鈥� can be home to all sorts of nasty germs that can make you sick, but the risk from bacteria on doorknobs is likely heavily overstated. While it can be an issue in bathrooms that experience heavy use, the risk at home is minor, and the benefit to keeping handles clean has more to do with no one liking to touch a sticky or dirty doorknob than a health issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour smartphone\r\n\r\n\r\nFor something we use for hours every day, when鈥檚 the last time you did more than just wipe off your smartphone鈥檚 screen when it was too smudged to see through? In reality, considering how often we use our phones, and where we use them (yes, that includes checking Facebook on the toilet), our phones deserve a more thorough cleaning from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSure, a little grease from your hands isn鈥檛 the end of the world, but that array of pretty foul bacteria thriving on your phone shouldn鈥檛 make you happy. Plus, keeping your device clean works in your favor in other ways too 鈥� it keeps your screen clean and easy to read, and it keeps dust and grime out of speaker grates, away from charging ports and out of headphone jacks (if you even have one of those anymore).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you plan to sell the phone in a few months or years to help fund the latest and greatest model, keeping yours clean now will make sure it stays free of scratches and dings for the long haul. Luckily, we have a complete guide to cleaning your phone, tablet and other gadgets to get you started.\r\n\r\n\r\nStart with a microfiber cloth to pick up grease and dust (avoid paper towels and other materials that鈥檒l just push it around). For those stubborn spots or anything that won鈥檛 come up, reach for some isopropyl alcohol. Mix a solution of 1 to 1 alcohol and water, then moisten a microfiber cloth and gently rub those spots and stains away.

And considering many of us snack or take lunch at our desks, drink over our computers, or even spill beverages on them, you can imagine the gross, grimy world living just below those keys.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd while there鈥檚 certainly no shortage of bombastic headlines trumpeting that your keyboard is dirtier than a toilet seat (a bit of a misconception, as toilet seats tend to be fairly clean compared to other bathroom surfaces), so-called high-touch surfaces like keyboards really can harbor and grow harmful bacteria if left uncleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, cleaning a keyboard isn鈥檛 too difficult to do, as this extremely thorough guide from tech site How-To Geek explains. You may be startled by what you find beneath those keys, if you go so far as to pull the key caps up and clean out the dirt, grime, hair and crumbs that likely lurk underneath.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if you don鈥檛, flipping the keyboard upside down and shaking the debris out, then using a small hand-held vacuum cleaner or can of compressed air will do the job as well. Then a quick wipe down with cleaning wipes, cotton swabs or a microfiber cloth moistened with that same 1:1 alcohol-to-water solution we mentioned earlier will take care of the parts you actually touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour remote control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBe honest: Have you ever cleaned your remote control? Whether you use the one that came with your TV or something complicated that came from your cable company, odds are you pick it up every time you flop down on the couch to Netflix and chill. But you鈥檝e never even so much as wiped the grime and dirt from the valleys between the buttons, have you?\r\n\r\n\r\nThat grime can add up, if you think about how many times you鈥檝e likely snacked in front of the screen. Whether your preference is popcorn, chips or full-blown meals, your remote is likely filthy 鈥� and again, while it鈥檚 unlikely you鈥檒l get sick from that crusty, grimy thing, it certainly isn鈥檛 doing anything for the life of the gadget you rely on to relax after a long day of work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reality though, remote controls, especially the ones in hotel rooms that are often used by a rotating crew of people without ever being cleaned, are pretty gross with bacteria. While we can make the case that you might use a disinfecting cleaning wipe on the one in your hotel the next time you travel, there鈥檚 no reason to wait until you leave home. Grab a wipe and give the one you use every day a good wipe down, and try to make it part of your cleaning routine. It probably won鈥檛 make you healthier, but it will prolong the life of your remote, and that鈥檚 enough for us.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour pillows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may not know it, but most pillows are designed to be machine washable. You鈥檒l have to fluff them when they come out of the washer (or the dryer, if the manufacturer suggests drying them), and you don鈥檛 want to wash them too often or they鈥檒l lose their shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it鈥檚 a good thing too, considering pillows tend to be exactly where dead skin, dust, drool and in many cases, dust mites love to hang out. For most people, that鈥檚 not a huge deal, aside from the fact that they鈥檙e putting their face on a gross, dirty pillow at night to sleep. For people with compromised immune systems or who have allergies, they can be an irritant that makes for sleepless nights, skin irritation and sinus congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuckily for all of us, whether you have allergies or you just don鈥檛 like the idea of a gross pillow under your head while you sleep, the solution is easy: a trip through the washing machine on the delicate cycle, then tumble dry low or air dry. If you like, take things a step further and invest in a quality pillow protector.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile you鈥檙e at it, consider cleaning your comforters if you haven鈥檛 recently, and some other household textiles mentioned in this list of home products you probably don鈥檛 clean as often as you should, from Wirecutter, the New York Times鈥� product review site. Then you can breathe easy while you rest.\r\n缂栬緫:缁欏姏鑻辫鏂伴椈  鏇存柊:2018骞�4鏈�3鏃� 浣滆��:绾界害鏃舵姤锛圓LAN HENRY锛�\r\n涓�浜涘熀鏈殑瀹跺姟浜嬪浣犳潵璇翠笉鍦ㄨ瘽涓嬶細娲楄。鏈嶏紝淇濇寔鍗敓闂寸殑娓呮磥锛屾摝鎷帹鎴垮彴闈⑩�斺�斾絾鐏板皹鍜屾薄鍨㈡湁涓潖姣涚梾锛屽枩娆㈣仛绉湪鏈�濂囨�殑鍦版柟锛屽叾涓寘鎷綘鏍规湰鎯充笉璧峰幓鐪嬩笂涓�鐪间箣澶勩�傚鏋滀綘鎯宠褰诲簳娓呯悊鎴垮瓙鐨勮瘽锛岀湅鐪嬩笅鏂囧垪鍑虹殑瀹朵腑涓�浜涗綘搴旇鑰冭檻鏇撮绻佹竻鐞嗙殑鍦版柟锛屽洜涓哄畠浠彲鑳界浉褰撹偖鑴忋��\r\n\r\n\r\n鎴戜滑鍏堣璇存槑涓�鐐癸紝浣犲簲璇ユ竻鐞嗚繖浜涘湴鏂瑰苟涓嶆槸鍥犱负瀹冧滑浼氳浣犺韩浣撲笉閫備箣绫荤殑锛岃�屾槸鍥犱负瀹冧滑鍙兘寰堣剰锛屽鏄撹棌姹＄撼鍨€�傚畠浠篃璁歌繕浼氳仛绉粏鑿岋紝涓嶈繃鎴戜滑娌″繀瑕佸鎬曞緱涓嶈銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鑷韩鍏嶇柅澶辫皟鎴栧鏄撶敓鐥呯殑浜猴紝鎴栬搴旇姣斿叾浠栦汉鏇寸暀蹇冿紝浣嗕綘鐨勬竻娲佸伐浣滀究鏄瀹冧滑鍦ㄥ緢闀夸竴娈垫椂闂撮噷淇濇寔鑹ソ宸ヤ綔鐘舵�佺殑濂藉姙娉曘��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n闂ㄦ妸鎵�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣犲彲鑳芥病鎯宠繃瑕侀潪甯搁绻佸湴娓呮磥瀹朵腑鍚勫鐨勯棬鎶婃墜锛屼絾涓嬫鎵撴壂鍚屼竴涓埧闂存椂锛屾湁蹇呰椤轰究鎿︽嫮涓�涓嬪畠浠�傞壌浜庢垜浠細闈炲父棰戠箒鍦拌Е纰板涓殑闂ㄦ妸鎵嬶紝灏ゅ叾鏄湪鎵嬪緢鑴忔垨杩涘嚭娲楁墜闂寸殑鏃跺�欙紝涔熻浣犺繕搴旇鎶婅繖绉嶅仛娉曞彉鎴愪竴绉嶄範鎯��\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n浣犳垨璁稿惉璇磋繃锛岄棬鎶婃墜鈥斺�斿挨鍏舵槸鍗敓闂寸殑闂ㄦ妸鎵嬧�斺�斿彲浠ユ垚涓虹绉嶄护浜哄帉鎭剁殑鑷寸梾鎬х粏鑿岀殑娓╁簥锛屼笉杩囬棬鎶婃墜涓婄殑缁嗚弻鎵�甯︽潵鐨勯闄╁彲鑳借涓ラ噸澶稿ぇ浜嗐�傚湪琚噸搴︿娇鐢ㄧ殑鍗敓闂撮噷锛岃繖浼氭垚涓轰竴涓棶棰橈紱浣嗗湪瀹堕噷锛屽叾椋庨櫓寰笉瓒抽亾锛屼笌淇濇寔鎶婃墜娓呮磥鐨勫ソ澶勬洿涓虹浉鍏崇殑涓嶆槸鍋ュ悍闂锛岃�屾槸娌℃湁浜烘効鎰忚Е纰伴粡绯婄硦鎴栬偖鑴忕殑闂ㄦ妸鎵嬨��\r\n\r\n\r\n浣犵殑鏅鸿兘鎵嬫満\r\n\r\n\r\n鏅鸿兘鎵嬫満鏄垜浠瘡澶╅兘浼氶暱鏃堕棿浣跨敤鐨勭墿浠讹紝浣嗕綘鏈�鍚庝竴娆″洜涓烘墜鏈哄睆骞曡剰鍒板暐涔熺湅涓嶆竻鑰屾摝鎷畠鏄粈涔堟椂鍊欙紵浜嬪疄涓婏紝鑰冭檻鍒版垜浠娇鐢ㄦ墜鏈烘湁澶氶绻侊紝鍙堟槸鍦ㄤ粈涔堝湴鐐癸紙娌￠敊锛屾垜浠細鍧愬湪椹《涓婃煡鐪婩acebook涓婄殑淇℃伅锛夛紝鎴戜滑鐪熷簲璇ユ椂涓嶆椂鏇村姞褰诲簳鍦版竻娲佷竴涓嬭嚜宸辩殑鎵嬫満銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n褰撶劧浜嗭紝鏉ヨ嚜浣犳墜閮ㄧ殑涓�鐐瑰効娌硅剛骞朵笉鑳芥瘉鐏笘鐣岋紝浣嗕竴鍫嗚偖鑴忕殑缁嗚弻鍦ㄤ綘鐨勬墜鏈轰笂娆ｆ鍚戣崳鍦扮敓闀匡紝缁濅笉鏄护浜烘剦鎮︾殑浜嬨�備繚鎸佹墜鏈虹殑娓呮磥杩樹細甯︽潵鍏朵粬濂藉鈥斺�旇繖鏍峰仛鑳借鎵嬫満灞忓箷娓呮竻鐖界埥锛屾柟渚夸綘鏌ョ湅淇℃伅锛岃兘璁╁皹鍩冨拰姹″灑杩滅鎵０鍣ㄦ牸鏍呫�佸厖鐢电鍙ｅ拰鑰虫満鎻掑彛锛堝鏋滀綘鐨勬墜鏈轰笂杩樻湁杩欎簺涓滆タ鐨勮瘽锛夈��\r\n\r\n\r\n濡傛灉浣犳墦绠楀啀杩囧嚑涓湀鎴栧嚑骞村氨鍗栨帀鏃ф墜鏈猴紝鐢ㄦ墍寰楁椤硅创琛ヨ喘缃渶鏂版渶妫掔殑鍨嬪彿鎵�闇�鐨勮垂鐢紝閭ｄ箞鐜板湪灏卞紑濮嬩繚鎸佹墜鏈虹殑娓呮磥鍚э紝浠ヤ究纭繚瀹冨湪寰堥暱鏃堕棿閲岃繙绂诲垝鐥曞拰灏忓潙銆傚垢杩愮殑鏄紝鎴戜滑鏈変竴浠芥竻娲佹墜鏈恒�佸钩鏉跨數鑴戜互鍙婂叾浠栬澶囩殑瀹屽叏鎸囧崡锛屽彲浠ュ府浣犺鍔ㄨ捣鏉ャ��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍏堢敤瓒呯粏绾ょ淮甯冮櫎鍘绘补鑴傚拰鐏板皹锛堥伩鍏嶄娇鐢ㄧ焊宸句互鍙婂叾浠栨潗鏂欙紝瀹冧滑鍙細鎶婅剰涓滆タ鎺ㄥ緱鍒板閮芥槸锛夈�傞亣鍒伴〗鍥虹殑姹＄偣锛屾垨寮勪笉鎺夌殑浠讳綍涓滆タ锛屽彲浠ユ潵鐐瑰効寮備笝閱囥�傛妸寮備笝閱囧拰姘翠互涓�姣斾竴鐨勬瘮渚嬫贩鍚堬紝灏嗚秴缁嗙氦缁村竷娑︽箍锛岀劧鍚庤交杞绘摝鍘绘薄娓嶃�傚闇�鏇村鎻愮ず锛岃鏌ョ湅鏉ヨ嚜Greenbot鐨勮繖涓垎姝ユ暀绋嬨��\r\n\r\n\r\n浣犵殑鐢佃剳閿洏\r\n\r\n\r\n濡傛灉娌″湪鐢ㄦ墜鏈猴紝閭ｄ綘鍙兘鍦ㄧ敤鍙板紡鐢佃剳鎴栫瑪璁版湰鐢佃剳锛岃繖鎰忓懗鐫�浣犵殑鎵嬫寚浼氫笉鏂Е纰伴敭鐩樸�傞壌浜庢垜浠緢澶氫汉浼氬湪妗屾梺鍚冮浂椋熸垨鍗堥锛屽湪鐢佃剳涓婃柟鍠濅笢瑗匡紝鐢氳嚦鎶婇ギ鏂欐拻寰楀埌澶勯兘鏄紝浣犲彲浠ユ兂璞￠偅浜涙寜閿簳涓嬪瓨鍦ㄧ潃涓�涓鑴忕殑涓栫晫銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n璇氱劧锛屽緢澶氭柊闂绘爣棰橀兘棰囦负鑰稿姩锛岃浠�涔堜綘鐨勯敭鐩樻瘮椹《搴у湀杩樿剰锛堣繖鍏朵腑瀛樺湪涓�鐐瑰効璇В锛屼笌鍗敓闂撮噷鐨勫叾浠栬〃闈㈢浉姣旓紝椹《搴у湀寰�寰�鐩稿綋骞插噣锛夛紱浣嗗鏋滀笉缁忓父娓呯悊锛岄敭鐩樹箣绫绘墍璋撶殑楂樻帴瑙﹂鐜囪〃闈紝鐨勭‘浼氭垚涓烘湁瀹崇粏鑿岃棌韬拰鐢熼暱鐨勬俯搴娿��\r\n\r\n\r\n濂芥秷鎭槸锛屾濡傛潵鑷鎶�缃戠珯How-To Geek鐨勮繖浠芥瀬鍏惰缁嗙殑鎸囧崡鎵�闃愯堪鐨勶紝娓呮磥閿洏骞朵笉澶毦銆傚鏋滆繘琛屾繁搴︽竻娲侊紝鎷嗘帀閿附锛屾妸鍙兘闅愯棌鍦ㄤ笅杈圭殑鐏板皹銆佹薄鍨€�佸ご鍙戝拰纰庡睉娓呯悊鍑烘潵锛屼綘鎴栬浼氶渿鎯婁簬閭ｄ簺鎸夐敭搴曚笅绔熺劧钘忕潃閭ｄ箞澶氫笢瑗裤��\r\n\r\n\r\n鍗充究涓嶈繖鏍峰仛锛屼綘鍙缈昏浆閿洏锛屾妸纰庡睉鎽囨檭鍑烘潵锛屽啀鐢ㄥ皬鍨嬫墜鎸佺湡绌哄惛灏樺櫒鎴栫綈瑁呭帇缂╃┖姘斿鐞嗕竴涓嬶紝涔熷彲浠ヨ揪鍒板緢濂界殑鏁堟灉銆傜劧鍚庣敤娓呮磥绾稿肪銆佹绛炬垨鍓嶆枃鎻愬埌鐨勪互娴撳害涓�50%鐨勫紓涓欓唶婧舵恫娑︽箍鐨勮秴缁嗙氦缁村竷锛屼粩缁嗘竻鐞嗕綘姣忓ぉ鐪熸瑙︾鐨勯儴鍒嗐��\r\n\r\n\r\n浣犵殑閬ユ帶鍣�\r\n\r\n\r\n璇疯�佸疄鍥炵瓟锛氫竴鐩翠互鏉ヤ綘娓呯悊杩囬仴鎺у櫒鍚楋紵涓嶈鐢ㄧ殑鏄櫘閫氱殑鐢佃閬ユ帶鍣紝杩樻槸鏇村鏉傜殑鏉ヨ嚜鏈夌嚎鐢佃鍏徃鐨勯偅绉嶏紝姣忓綋浣犲�掑湪娌欏彂涓婏紝澶х害閮戒細鎷胯捣瀹冭皟鍙帮紝鐒跺悗鏀炬澗涓�涓嬨�備絾浣犳摝鎷寜閽棿鐨勬薄鍨㈠拰鐏板皹鐨勯鐜囩粷瀵规病鏈夐偅涔堥珮锛屽鍚э紵\r\n\r\n\r\n姹″灑浼氳秺绉秺澶氾紝鎯虫兂浣犲湪灞忓箷鍓嶅悆杩囧灏戞闆堕灏辩煡閬撲簡銆備笉璁轰綘鍋忕埍鐖嗙背鑺便�佽柉鐗囪繕鏄洿涓扮洓鐨勯椋燂紝浣犵殑閬ユ帶鍣ㄩ兘鏈夊彲鑳藉彉寰楀緢鑴忊�斺�斿悓鏍凤紝閭ｄ簺椤藉浐鐨勮剰涓滆タ涓嶅ぇ鍙兘瀵艰嚧浣犵敓鐥咃紝浣嗚偗瀹氬浣犲湪宸ヤ綔涓�鏁村ぉ涔嬪悗璧栦互鏀炬澗鐨勮澶囩殑浣跨敤瀵垮懡鍏ㄦ棤瑁ㄧ泭銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n瀹為檯涓婏紝閬ユ帶鍣ㄩ潪甯歌剰锛屽竷婊＄粏鑿岋紝灏ゅ叾鏄厭搴楁埧闂撮噷閭ｄ簺甯稿父琚笉鍚岀殑浜鸿疆鐣娇鐢ㄥ嵈浠庢湭琚竻鐞嗚繃鐨勯仴鎺с�傛垜浠垨璁稿彲浠ヨ瀹氾紝涓嬫鏃呰鏃朵綘浼氱敤娑堟瘨娓呮磥绾稿肪鎿︽嫮閰掑簵閲岀殑閬ユ帶鍣紝浣嗕负浠�涔堥潪瑕佺瓑鍒扮瀹跺湪澶栧憿銆傝鎷胯捣涓�寮犵焊宸撅紝濂藉ソ鎿︽嫮涓�涓嬩綘姣忓ぉ閮藉湪浣跨敤鐨勯仴鎺у櫒锛屽苟璁炬硶灏嗗叾鍙樻垚鏃ュ父娓呮磥宸ヤ綔鐨勪竴閮ㄥ垎銆傝繖涔堝仛鎴栬涓嶄細璁╀綘鍙樺緱鏇村仴搴凤紝鍗村彲浠ュ欢闀块仴鎺у櫒鐨勪娇鐢ㄥ鍛斤紝杩欏氨澶熶簡銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n浣犵殑鏋曞ご\r\n\r\n\r\n浣犳垨璁镐笉鐭ラ亾锛屼絾澶у鏁版灂澶撮兘琚璁℃垚浜嗗彲鏈烘礂浜у搧銆傛妸鏋曞ご浠庢礂琛ｆ満锛堟垨骞叉礂鏈猴紝濡傛灉鐢熶骇鍟嗗缓璁共娲楃殑璇濓級閲屾嬁鍑烘潵鐨勬椂鍊欙紝浣犲繀椤绘姈涓�鎶栧畠浠紝璁╁畠浠彉寰楄摤鏉撅紱涓嶈娲楀緱澶嫟锛屼互鍏嶅彉褰€��\r\n\r\n\r\n娲楁灂澶翠篃鏄ソ涔犳儻锛屽洜涓烘灂澶村線寰�鏄鐨�佺伆灏樸�佸彛姘寸殑鑱氬眳鍦帮紝甯稿父杩樻湁寰堝灏樿灗鍑烘病銆傚澶氭暟浜烘潵璇达紝杩欐病澶氬ぇ鍏崇郴锛岄櫎浜嗘櫄涓婄潯瑙夋椂浠栦滑鐨勮劯寰楀拰鑴忓叜鍏殑鏋曞ご璐村湪涓�璧枫�傚鍏嶇柅鍔熻兘涓嶅叏鎴栨湁杩囨晱鐥囩殑浜烘潵璇达紝灏辨槸楹荤儲浜嬩簡锛屽彲鑳藉紩鍙戝け鐪狅紝鍒烘縺鐨偆锛屾垨閫犳垚榧荤鍫靛銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n鎴戜滑閮藉緢骞歌繍锛屼笉璁烘槸鏈夎繃鏁忕棁锛岃繕鏄崟绾湴涓嶅枩娆㈠湪澶滈噷鏋曠潃鑴忓叜鍏殑鏋曞ご鐫¤锛屽姙娉曢兘寰堢畝鍗曪細璁╂灂澶村湪璋冩垚杞绘煍娲楁ā寮忕殑娲楄。鏈洪噷婧滆揪涓�鍦堝効锛岀劧鍚庝綆娓╃儤骞诧紝鎴栧湪瀹ゆ俯涓嬫櫨骞层�傚鏋滄効鎰忥紝浣犲彲浠ユ洿杩涗竴姝ワ紝鍏ユ墜楂樺搧璐ㄧ殑鏋曞銆�\r\n\r\n\r\n娲楁灂澶存椂锛屼笉濡ㄨ�冭檻涓�涓嬫竻娲楄瀛愨�斺�斿鏋滄渶杩戞病娲楄繃鐨勮瘽鈥斺�斾互鍙娿�婄航绾︽椂鎶ャ�嬫棗涓嬩骇鍝佽瘎璁虹綉绔橶irecutter鐨勪竴浠芥竻鍗曟彁鍒扮殑鍏朵粬涓�浜涘鐢ㄧ汉缁囧搧锛岃繖浠芥竻鍗曞垪鍑轰簡浣犳垨璁稿簲璇ユ洿棰戠箒娓呮磥鐨勫灞呯敤鍝併�傜劧鍚庝綘浼戞伅鏃跺氨鍙互鏇寸晠蹇湴鍛煎惛浜嗐��\r\n\r\n\r\n缈昏瘧锛氭潕鐞�"
