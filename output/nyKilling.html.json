He pronounced the latest official Saudi account Mr. Khashoggi disappearance — that he was strangled to death by accident during an attempt to persuade him to come home — “the worst cover up ever.” He had deemed it “credible” just a few days before.\r\n\n在华盛顿，特朗普总统对他的沙特盟友提出了迄今为止最严厉的批评。他说，沙特官方对于卡舒吉失踪的最新说辞——在试图说服他回国时失手将其勒死——是“史上最烂的掩盖说辞”。而就在几天前，他还认为这是“可信的”。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n周二，在看起来是经过安排的场合中，穆罕默德王储与卡舒吉的儿子握手。\n\r\nIn its first punitive response in the three weeks since the disappearance, the administration also said it would revoke the visas of 21 Saudis suspected of killing Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist.\r\n\n作为卡舒吉失踪以来的首次惩罚性反应，美国政府还表示，将吊销涉嫌杀害弗吉尼亚州居民、《华盛顿邮报》专栏作家卡舒吉的21名沙特人的签证。\r\n\nMr. Erdogan, with his speech on Tuesday, has now committed himself to exploiting the international uproar over the killing to inflict as much damage as possible on the public image of the crown prince, who had marketed himself to the West as a bold reformer and pivotal ally. At the same time, Mr. Erdogan continued to hold in reserve his biggest gun: the release of an audio recording and other evidence Turkish officials claim to have of the assassination.\r\n\n埃尔多安周二发表讲话时承诺，要利用这起杀人事件在国际社会所引发的轩然大波，尽可能损害王储的公众形象。此前，这位王储在西方把自己塑造成一个大胆的改革者和关键盟友。与此同时，埃尔多安继续手握其最大的武器：公布一段录音以及其他土耳其官员声称与暗杀有关的证据。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nWith his own display of political muscle at the investor conference, Prince Mohammed flaunted his refusal to pull back in the face of the scandal, demonstrating that the lure of kingdom’s vast oil deposits and sovereign wealth fund could still compel executives to pay tribute despite the backlash.\r\n\n王储穆罕默德在这次投资者大会上展示了自己的政治实力，彰显自己面对丑闻拒绝退缩，表明尽管存在强烈反对，沙特庞大的石油储备和主权财富基金仍然可以迫使高管们向其致敬。\r\n\nIt hardly seemed to matter that there were empty rows of gilded chairs at the afternoon sessions. The Saudi royal court said it would announce $50 billion worth of deals from the conference, with companies from Hyundai to Halliburton.\r\n\n在下午的会议上，一排排镀金的空椅子似乎无关紧要。沙特王室表示，它将宣布这次会议达成了价值500亿美元的交易，对象包括现代(Hyundai)、哈利伯顿(Halliburton)等公司。\r\n\nAnd in a pointed message to Washington, the Saudi media lavished special attention on a Russian fund manager close to President Vladimir Putin.\r\n\n沙特媒体对一位与俄罗斯总统普京关系密切的俄罗斯基金经理给予了特别关注，这成为向华盛顿发出的一种针对性的信息。\r\n\n“Saudi Arabia is a great partner for us,” the fund manager, Kirill Dmitriev, proclaimed.\r\n\n“沙特阿拉伯是我们的好伙伴，”这位名叫基里尔·德米特里耶夫(Kirill Dmitriev)的基金经理宣称。\r\n\nIt was a tacit reminder to the world that, at 33 years old, the crown prince could remain among the powerful figures in the Middle East for decades no matter what evidence Turkey produces.\r\n\n这是对世界一个心照不宣的提醒：不管土耳其拿出什么证据来，这位33岁的王储在未来的数十年时间里，都将是中东的权势人物。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n穆罕默德王储的投资者大会成为了他政治力量的展示。\n\r\nAs if to drive that home, he stopped in front of video cameras at a palace in Riyadh to express condolences over a carefully staged handshake with Mr. Khashoggi’s son, Salah.\r\n\n似乎是为了阐明这一点，在利雅得的一座宫殿中，他在镜头前停下，与卡舒吉的儿子萨拉赫(Salah)来了一次精心安排的握手，向他表达哀悼。\r\n\nSalah Khashoggi, who has been barred from leaving the kingdom, looked pained. His father was a well-known critic of the crown prince and a growing number of current and former Western officials with experience in the kingdom have said that the crown prince almost certainly authorized the killing.\r\n\n被禁止离开沙特的萨拉赫·卡舒吉显得很痛苦。他的父亲对王储的批评态度是出了名的，并且，有越来越多熟悉该国的现任及前任西方官员表示，几乎可以肯定，是王储下令将其杀害的。\r\n\nHis son appeared to have little choice about the handshake, which was broadcast over Saudi-owned media.\r\n\n他的儿子似乎对握手没什么选择余地，而这个场面在沙特拥有的媒体上得到了播放。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nThe crown prince “has definitely established a climate of fear inside the kingdom, and the Khashoggi killing has only reinforced that,” said Bruce Riedel, a former American intelligence official specializing in Saudi Arabia.\r\n\n王储“肯定在王国内部打造出了恐惧氛围，卡舒吉被害案更是强化了这一点，”专攻沙特阿拉伯的前美国情报官员布鲁斯·里德尔(Bruce Riedel)说。\r\n\nThe investor conference took place in the same hotel that the prince used last year as a prison to detain about 200 businessmen and royals while he squeezed them to turn over billions of dollars he claimed had been obtained through unspecified corruption.\r\n\n投资者大会的会址，正是去年王储用来拘押约200名商人和王室成员的那家酒店，当时他强迫他们交出数以十亿计的美元，王储声称这些资金是通过腐败得来的，但他没有说明腐败的具体情况。\r\n\nBut if the crown prince’s power appears unchallenged inside the kingdom, Mr. Erdogan also made clear Tuesday that he has no intention of backing off what appears to be an escalating campaign to discredit the crown prince in the eyes of much of the rest of the world.\r\n\n但如果看起来无人在王国内挑战王储的权力，埃尔多安周二还说得很清楚，在这场全世界许多人看起来是在败坏王储名声、不断升级的运动中，他毫无后退的打算。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n卡舒吉在伊斯坦布尔领事馆被害案已经成为了沙特阿拉伯和土耳其当权者之间的政治斗争。\n\r\nIn his first public statements detailing the accusations about Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, Mr. Erdogan charged Tuesday that as soon as the diplomats in the consulate knew Mr. Khashoggi would be coming back for a document, one flew back to Riyadh, where “a road map started to be established.” Then a team of 15 Saudi agents had flown to Istanbul on Oct. 2 for an ambush.\r\n\n周二，埃尔多安首次在公开声明中给出关于卡舒吉被害案的详细指控，他称领事馆里的外交官在得知卡舒吉会回来取文件后，立即有一人飞回了利雅得，在那里，“一个路线图开始被规划出来了”。然后，一个由15名沙特特工组成的小组10月2日飞至伊斯坦布尔准备设伏。\r\n\n“It is clear that this savage murder did not happen instantly but was planned,” Mr. Erdogan said, directly challenging the Saudi account and demanding punishment “to the highest levels.”\r\n\n“很明显，这起野蛮谋杀不是突然发生的，而是经过计划的，”埃尔多安的说法直接驳斥了沙特的陈述，并且要求进行“最严厉的”惩罚。\r\n\nOther Turkish officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have already let out more lurid details said to come from confidential intelligence: that within minutes of Mr. Khashoggi’s arrival in the consulate the team had killed and dismembered him. Reports that the team included a top Saudi doctor specializing in autopsies who brought a bone saw to the consulate have given the crown prince, often known as M.B.S., a new nickname — Mr. Bone Saw.\r\n\n此前，其他在匿名条件下发言的土耳其官员已经透露了更多可怕的细节，据说来自于机密情报：卡舒吉在抵达领事馆的几分钟内即遭该行动小组杀害和肢解。有报道称小组中包括一名专长于剖检的顶级沙特医生，该医生带了一把骨锯到领事馆里。这样的报道为人称“M.B.S.”的王储带来了一个新外号——骨锯先生(Mr. Bone Saw)。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安希望利用沙特批评人士被害案引起的愤怒对沙特王储造成尽可能多的伤害。 \n\r\n“The Saudis are under pressure that they can’t buy their way out of this time,” said Aaron David Miller, a former state department official and scholar at the Wilson Center. “Neither their oil nor their money are going to be able to erase the stain, or silence the glee of their enemies, including Erdogan.”\r\n\n“沙特人承受着压力，他们这次没法用钱脱身了，”前国务院官员、威尔逊中心(Wilson Center)学者亚伦·戴维·米勒(Aaron David Miller)表示。“他们的石油和金钱都没法抹去这个污点，或者压制住敌人的幸灾乐祸，这其中就包括埃尔多安。”\r\n\nMr. Erdogan’s speech on Tuesday seemed mainly aimed at an audience of two: King Salman, the crown prince’s aging father, and President Trump.\r\n\n埃尔多安周二的讲话似乎主要是说给两个听众的：王储日渐衰老的父亲萨勒曼国王，以及特朗普总统。\r\n\nMr. Erdogan at least twice singled out King Salman for praise and deference.\r\n\n埃尔多安至少有两次专门提到萨勒曼国王，对他表示赞美和尊重。\r\n\n“I do not doubt the sincerity of King Salman,” he said.\r\n\n“我不怀疑萨勒曼国王的真诚，”他说。\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n3月，王储与特朗普总统在椭圆形办公室会面。 \n\r\nThe king is the only one in Saudi Arabia who might curb the power of the crown prince without an act of violence, and Mr. Erdogan appeared to seek to divide them.\r\n\n这位国王是沙特阿拉伯唯一可能在不使用暴力的情况下遏制王储权力的人，而埃尔多安似乎在谋求分化他们。\r\n\nWithout mentioning Prince Mohammed by name, Mr. Erdogan “distinguished between King Salman and all the other suspect people in Saudi Arabia,” said Yasin Aktay, an adviser to President Erdogan and a senior official of his ruling Justice and Development party. “He said he is asking for and he expects the king to address the demands for justice.”\r\n\n埃尔多安没有道出穆罕默德王子的姓名，他“将萨勒曼国王及所有其他沙特阿拉伯的嫌疑人都区分开来”，埃尔多安总统的顾问、执政的正义与发展党(Justice and Development Party)高级官员亚辛·阿克塔伊(Yasin Aktay)表示。“他说他请求，并希望国王能面对公正的诉求。”\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n\n\r\nHe also respectfully cited a recent phone call with President Trump.\r\n\n他还带着尊重地提到了近期与特朗普总统的一次通话。\r\n\n“We have agreed to bring light to every aspect of this issue,” Mr. Erdogan said.\r\n\n“我们已经同意揭露这个问题的每个方面，”埃尔多安表示。\r\n\nTwo people close to Mr. Erdogan, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss conversations with the president, said he believes persuading Mr. Trump to abandon Prince Mohammed would be a prerequisite to any attempt to constrain or remove him.\r\n\n两名亲近埃尔多安、在匿名条件下讨论与总统对话的人士表示，他认为若想限制或撤换穆罕默德王子，首先得说服特朗普放弃他。\r\n\nTurkish officials have been feeding graphic leaks to the news media about Mr. Khashoggi’s killing in part to try to turn American public opinion and thus Mr. Trump against Prince Mohammed.\r\n\n土耳其官员一直在向新闻媒体泄露关于卡舒吉被害案的图像，部分目的在于试图改变美国舆论的方向，然后让特朗普针对穆罕默德王子。\r\n\nYet turning the White House against the prince appears unlikely, in part because the president’s son-in-law and Middle East adviser Jared Kushner has invested deeply in Prince Mohammed as a pillar of the administration’s strategies to both contain Iran and secure Israel.\r\n\n然而，让白宫针对这位王子似乎不太可能，有一部分原因在于总统女婿、中东问题顾问贾里德·库什纳(Jared Kushner)在穆罕默德王子身上投入很大，是特朗普政府遏制伊朗、保障以色列的策略的支柱。\r\n\nPrince Mohammed had grinned through a photo session on Monday with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and his visit appeared to convey the continued support of the White House, Mr. Trump’s subsequent comments notwithstanding.\r\n\n周一，在与美国财政部长史蒂文·马努钦(Steven Mnuchin)合影时，穆罕默德王子全程面露笑容，尽管有特朗普随后的评论，马努钦的访问似乎传达了白宫对王子的持续支持。\r\n\nMr. Erdogan understands this, the two people close to him said. But he has evidently calculated that the chance to weaken Prince Mohammed by tarring him with the Khashoggi killing is worth the risk of facing him as a hostile of ruler of Saudi Arabia for the next 50 years.\r\n\n前述两位知情人士说，埃尔多安明白这一点。但他明显衡量过，与未来50年面对穆罕默德王子这个抱有敌意的沙特阿拉伯统治者相比，通过卡舒吉被害案损害其名声、削弱其势力的做法是值得尝试的。\r\n\nDavid D.
